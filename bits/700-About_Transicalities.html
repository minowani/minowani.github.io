<h3 class="nav">About Transicalities</h3>
<p>Here I address some Pāḷi words I head to deal with while their meaning is for me not directly discoverable nor is it unambiguously following from the texts. They are not <em>dhammā</em> and thus not showstoppers but because of some oddities I could not commit to the known translations. </p>

<p>The inferences made here are based on some grammar and logic but language does not need to work like that; so this doesn't give any guarantee. However since these inferences did tackle the oddities, while bringing up some positives,  I did decide to use them. </p>
