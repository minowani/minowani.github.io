<p>Majjhima Nikāya <br>
Cūḷasuññatasuttaṃ <br>
MN121  </p>

<p>So I learned:  </p>

<p>On one occasion the exalted one dwells at the eastern park, at Migāramātupāsāda, at Sāvatthi. 
OK, then senior Ānanda, on an evening occasion, returned from seclusion, went by there where the exalted one was.
Having gone up to the exalted one, having saluted, he sat down at one side.
OK, at one side seated, senior Ānanda said this to the exalted one:  </p>

<p>'On this one occasion, venerable, the exalted one he dwells amongst the Sakyans at a market town of the Sakyans, named Nagaraka. 
There I, venerable, learned face to face, received face to face from the exalted one:
'I by dwelling with emptiness, Ānanda, at present dwell a lot'.
I hope this is by me, venerable, well learned, well grasped, well attended to, well retained?'  </p>

<p>'Surely you got this, Ānanda, well learned, well grasped, well attended to, well retained.
I also in the prior, Ānanda, also at present, dwell at lot by dwelling with emptiness.
Also as that, Ānanda, this Migāramātupāsāda is empty of elephants, cows, horses and meres, empty of gold and silver, empty of female and male assemblies and so this is the non-emptiness, this what is: the generalization depending on the order of almsmen.
OK just so, Ānanda, an almsmen not attending to the perception of the village, not attending to the perception of men, pays attention to the generalization depending on the perception of the forest.
For him at the perception of the forest the mind jumps at, reconciles, establishes, is drawn to.
So he knows: '<em>What might be the wearinesses depending on the perception of the village, here those are not.</em> 
<em>What might be the wearinesses depending on the perception of men, here those are not.</em>
<em>And so this is the moderation of weariness, this what is: the generalization depending on the perception of the forest.</em>'
He knows: '<em>This is empty; from the perception of the village the perception is gone</em>', 
knows: '<em>This is empty; from the perception of men the perception is gone</em>', 
'<em>And so this is the non-emptiness, this what is: the generalization depending on the perception of the forest</em>'.
OK thus for what is not there by that he sees that is empty,
yet what is left there he knows that: '<em>Soothed this is</em>'.
So also for him this, Ānanda, exists being as it is; the undistorted clear entry into emptiness.</p>

<p>And further following, Ānanda, an almsmen not attending to the perception of men, not attending to the perception of the forest, pays attention to the generalization depending on the perception of the earth.
For him at the perception of the earth the mind jumps at, reconciles, establishes, is drawn to.
Also as that, Ānanda, a bull's hide, well spread by a hundred pegs, is having the folds gone away,
OK just so, Ānanda, an almsmen what of this earth are the highs and lows, rivers with difficult passages, places with stumps and thorns, irregular rocks,
is not attending to that all; he pays attention to the generalization depending on the perception of the earth.
For him at the perception of the earth the mind jumps at, reconciles, establishes, is drawn to.

For him thus from knowing, thus from seeing, and the mind emancipated from the drain of lust, and the mind emancipated from the drain of existence, and the minded emancipated from the drain of not knowing,
upon emancipation, thus emancipated, the knowledge is. 
He knows: '<em>Birth is barren, the clergy behaviour is fulfiled, done is what ought to be done, no more earning of presence</em>'.

<p>Also for whatever, Ānanda, in past durations, or recluses or clergymen obtaining the clean, the furthest, without a beyond, emptiness, they all dwelt obtaining just this clean, furthest, without a beyond, emptiness.
Also what for, Ānanda, in durations not yet come, or recluses or clergymen, obtaining the clean, the furthest, without a beyond, emptiness, they all will dwell obtaining just this clean, furthest, without a beyond, emptiness.
