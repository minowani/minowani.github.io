<p><em>Kamma</em> is often translated as action.</p>

<p><em>Kamma</em> has a different meaning outside our domain and this now finds its way in but in our context it is action. There are just these three ways in which we can do things: by body, by speech and by intellect. We can only do something just now right this moment and of course, what we do leads to result; we do something precisely <em>because</em> of an expected result. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>'Cetanāhaṃ, bhikkhave, kammaṃ vadāmi. <br>
Cetayitvā kammaṃ karoti kāyena vācāya manasā.'</em>   </p>

<p>'Intentionally, almsmen, is action I say. <br>
Intending the action one does by body, by speech, by intellect' (AN6.63). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That the exact 'result', the ripening of an action, is not found out is one thing, it is one of the four which should not be considered (AN4.77), but that there is ripening is to be understood. Action is not a matter of believing.</p>

<p>Do yourself a favour and don’t use <em>kamma</em> but use action instead, so that a misunderstanding is more easily spotted by and for yourself.</p>

<h4>Pāḷi-English</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Kamma</strong> (nt.) action.</p>
