<h3 class="nav">Nīvaraṇā</h3>
<p>A popular translation for <em>nīvaraṇā</em> is hindrances.</p>

<p>Language is a bit ambiguous so understand that they don't feel as a hindrance to you, quite the contrary, but they are showstoppers to wisdom.  </p>

<p>There are these five obstructions:</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Kāmacchanda</em></li>
<li><em>Byāpāda</em></li>
<li><em>Thinamiddha</em></li>
<li><em>Uddhaccakukkucca</em></li>
<li><em>Vicikicchā</em></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>1. Kāmacchanda</strong></p>

<p><em>Kāmacchanda</em> is a compound of <em>kāma</em> (lust) and <em>chanda</em> (desire) and the desire for lust is what normally drives one to find happiness when engaged with the world, not when drawn back from it. It depends on improper attention to an indication of attraction (<em>subhanimittaṃ</em>). The more that keeps being fed, the more it grows. The analogy given in SN46.55 is about a bowl of water mixed with various dyes which when used as a mirror gives a distorted view. Thus when open to it we get enchanted by all the beautiful colourings. When fed it consumes, obsesses, giving less room for more beneficial things. Under its influence we turn away from doing what is wise to do.</p>

<p><strong>2. Byāpāda</strong> </p>

<p><em>Byāpāda</em> is an obstruction which depends on an indication of friction (<em>paṭighanimittaṃ</em>) and with improper attention to that it appears and develops. The analogy given is about a bowl of water heated up which when used as a mirror gives a distorted view. The more heated up we are the less room we give for wise things. Heated up, out of friction, is generally an image for the display of anger. So lets call it just that. </p>



<p><strong>3. Thinamiddha</strong></p>

<p><em>Thinamiddha</em> is a compound of <em>thīna</em> + <em>middha</em>. <em>Thīna</em> is to congeal, and <em>middha</em> is 'to be fat', torpor. This obstruction gets fed by improper attention to things such as dislike or discontentment, weariness, yawning, drowsiness after a meal, mental sluggishness. The analogy given is a bowl of water covered up with weeds which couldn't be used as a mirror. Weed takes time to grow so one had no interest in keeping it tidy. Thus being bored or lazy; which makes you dull. Taken all together this obstruction seems to stand for that dullness. It wouldn't be to difficult to see dullness being a showstopper for wisdom.</p>

<p><strong>4. Uddhaccakukkucca</strong></p>

<p><em>Uddhaccakukkucca</em> is a compound of <em>uddhacca</em> and <em>kukkucca</em>, describing this obstruction. <em>Uddhacca</em> means something like agitation, excitement, and <em>kukkucca</em> bad doing, misconduct, bad character. Further is this obstruction fed by improper attention to things that bring no ease of mind (<em>cetaso avūpasamo</em>) so there is unrest. Agitation over bad doings, fed by unrest, describes what we could call remorse. The analogy is a bowl of water being stirred which when used as a mirror would give a distorted view.
And stirring up emotions or feelings, is what to excite is. 
 Being stirred with to much unrest, to excited, to leave it alone. To busy crying over spilled milk which is already generally understood as not being helpful for anything, let alone wisdom.  </p>

<p><strong>5. Vicikicchā</strong></p>

<p><em>Vicikicchā</em> comes from <em>vi+cikicchati</em>, dis-reflect. The analogy says one can't use a bowl with muddy water in the dark as mirror. Thus a visual distinction can't be made. All look the same; without clarity, obscure, vague. When this as yoke is dealt with then there is that clarity and then there is no doubt (<em>kankhā</em>). With doubt things might not be so clear, but at least they are clear enough to have doubt about them; they can be seen or considered (there is just no certainty about it) but when vague, lacking distinction, then as such it isn't even considered thus then there is not even that doubt. Unseen it will not be reflected on. This obstruction is fed by the improper attention to clarity lacking principles.</p>

<p><strong>In Common</strong></p>

<p>These five obstructions are all fed (to appear or grow) by improper attention:</p>

<ul>
<li>desire for lust by improper attention to an indication of attraction.</li>
<li>anger by improper attention to an indication of friction.</li>
<li>dullness by improper attention to dislike, weariness, drowsiness, etc.</li>
<li>remorse by improper attention to what brings no ease of mind.</li>
<li>unclarity by improper attention to clarity lacking principles.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus when paying proper attention, e.g. when honestly studying the texts, those obstructions are absent (SN46.38).</p>

<h4>Pāḷi-English</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Nīvaraṇā</strong> obstructions. <br>
<strong>Kāmacchanda</strong> desire for lust. <br>
<strong>Byāpāda</strong> anger. <br>
<strong>Thinamiddha</strong> dullness. <br>
<strong>Uddhaccakukkucca</strong> remorse. <br>
<strong>Vicikicchā</strong> unclarity.  </p>
