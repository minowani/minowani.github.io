<p>Welcome to this site, which I started to host Knowing, originally a talk basically on dependent-co-arising but due to it's length and depth I was never able to finish. By writing it down one can now read it back and forth at one's own pace. Because I am not a writer, nor is English my native language, there are no doubt a lot of grammar and style issues. And a home for Knowing should allow me to make the updates swiftly and with ease, that is why I started the site.</p>

<p>Over time there were some points I liked to address, some questions I did answer, which led to more content. Unlike Knowing there is no real order to read them in, just pick what piques your interest. Should you have any questions, found errors, or just want to discuss, feel free to contact me: minowani on @tutanota.com.</p>

<p>Perhaps these can be of aid on the journey to come to understand the principle for yourself. </p>

<p>Minowani.</p>
