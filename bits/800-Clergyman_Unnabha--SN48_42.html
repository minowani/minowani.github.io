<p>Situated at Sāvatthi.</p>

<p>OK, then clergyman Uṇṇābha approached there where the exalted one was.
 Having approached the exalted one he exchanged greetings with him.
OK, at one end seated clergyman Uṇṇābha said this to the exalted one:</p>

<p>'These five, dear Gotama, strengths of so and so realms, of so and so pasturelands, do not involve one another's realms and pasturelands.
Which five?
Strength of eye, strength of ear, strength of nose, strength of tongue, strength of body.
OK now, dear Gotama, of these five strengths of so and so realms, of so and so pasturelands, they do not involve one another's realms and pasturelands; what is the resort and what does it involve from those realms and pasturelands?'</p>

<p>'These five, clergyman, strengths of so and so realms, of so and so pasturelands do not involve one another's realms and pasturelands.
Which five?
Strength of eye, strength of ear, strength of nose, strength of tongue, strength of body.
OK these, clergyman, five strengths of so and so realms, of so and so pasturelands they do not involve one another's realms and pasturelands; 
intellect is the resort, it involves just the intellect from those realms and pasturelands.' </p>

<p>'Yet for intellect, dear Gotama, what is the resort?'</p>

<p>'OK for intellect, clergyman, meditation is the resort.'</p>

<p>'Yet for meditation, dear Gotama, what is the resort?'</p>

<p>'OK for meditation, clergyman, emancipation is the resort.'</p>

<p>'Yet for emancipation, dear Gotama, what is the resort?'</p>

<p>'OK for emancipation, clergyman, peace is the resort.'</p>

<p>'Yet for peace, dear Gotama, what is the resort?'</p>

<p>'You went over, clergyman, the question; you were not able to grasp the limit of the question. 
For immersing in peace, clergyman, the clergy conduct is spent. Peace is the relief, peace fulfils the stopping.'</p>

<p>OK then clergyman Uṇṇābha welcoming, appreciating, the exalted one's talk, rose, having saluted the exalted one, having kept the right, set out.
OK then the exalted one, when clergyman Uṇṇābha had recently set out, addressed the almsman:</p>

<p>'Also as that, almsmen, or a roofed home or a roofed pavilion with an eastern window, at sunrise, a ray of light entering the eastern window, where would it be established?' </p>

<p>'At the western wall, venerable.'</p>

<p>'OK just so, almsmen, the confidence of the clergyman Uṇṇābha in the Tathāgata is set, born at the root, established, firm, not to be shattered or by recluse or by clergyman or by deity or by Māra or by Brahma or by anything in the world.
This for if, almsmen, in the occasion the clergyman Uṇṇābha would have done his time: the yoke does not exist following by which, connected by the yoke, the clergyman Uṇṇābha would come back to this world.'</p>
