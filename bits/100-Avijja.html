<p><em>Avijjā</em> is often translated as ignorance.</p>

<p>I take <em>avijjā</em> to mean not knowing but that is not why this post is made. In SN12.2 this is said of <em>avijjā</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>'dukkhe aññāṇaṃ</em>, <em>dukkhasamudaye aññāṇaṃ</em>, <em>dukkhanirodhe aññāṇaṃ</em>, <em>dukkhanirodhagāminiyā paṭipadāya aññāṇaṃ</em>, <em>ayaṃ vuccati bhikkhave avijjā'</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which with ignorance for <em>avijjā</em> and not knowing for <em>aññāṇa</em> translates to something like this: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>'Not knowing suffering, not knowing the arising of suffering, not knowing the cessation of suffering, not knowing the way going to the cessation suffering; this is called ignorance'. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, rightly or wrongly, ignorance is often seen as linked to ignoring, and this then is used, in answering questions or in a discussion to point out <em>your</em> fault; not seldom seen together with <em>your</em> ego. A show stopper if you don't want to be rude; to continue to inquire would just be affirming what was just stated. </p>

<p>That ignorance is differently understood may have little to do with the Pāḷi, so we are free to look for synonyms. I use the same pair though but here it doesn't matter how ignorance is seen. </p>

<p><em>Aññāṇa</em> = <em>a + ñāṇa</em> = lack of knowledge = ignorance. And as for a link with ignoring: Perhaps you have already seen people asking whether or not it is about suffering because that is not their experience at all, or that it isn't about suffering but about happiness, or about unsatisfactoriness or stress. People don't tend to like talking about sickness, death, suffering and try to avoid or soften it. Not wanting to look into suffering, they thus turn a blind eye to it. And there on that level lies the ignoring. So ignorance then forms a basis <em>for</em> this not knowing. Thus:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>'What is the ignorance about suffering, ignorance about the rise of suffering, ignorance about the cessation of suffering, ignorance about the way going to the cessation of suffering; this is called, almsmen, not knowing.'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And now answering a question with 'because you don't know' would be a mood point to make. In the context of dependent-co-arising it wasn't about <em>your</em> ignorance or <em>you</em> don't know' in the first place, but in any case the discussion should now go a little different. To counter the lack of knowledge you <em>should</em> get yourself informed. So don't feel pressured to stop the questioning by the 'because of your ignorance/ego' arguments.</p>

<h4>Pāḷi-English</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Aññāṇa</strong> (nt.) ignorance. <br>
<strong>Avijjā</strong> (f.) not knowing.</p>
</blockquote>
