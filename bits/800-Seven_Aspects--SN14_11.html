<p>'These seven, almsmen, aspects.
Which seven?</p>

<p>The aspect of light, the aspect of beauty, the aspect of boundless sky as base, the aspect of boundless cognition as base, the aspect of possessionlessness as base, the aspect of neither-perception-nor-no-perception as base, the aspect of cessation of perception of the felt.
OK these, almsmen, are seven aspects.'</p>

<p>So said, a certain almsman said this to the exalted one:</p>

<p>'And this what is, venerable, the aspect of light, and what is the aspect of beauty, and what aspect of boundless sky as base and what is the aspect of boundless cognition as base, and what is the aspect of possessionlessness as base, and what is the aspect of neither-perception-nor-no-perception as base, and what is the aspect of cessation of perception of the felt,
OK now these, venerable, the aspects, depending on what are they to be fathomed?'</p>

<p>'This what is, almsmen, the aspect of light,
this aspect is fathomed depending on darkness.
This what is, almsman, the aspect beauty,
this aspect is fathomed depending on ugly.
This what is, almsmen, the aspect of boundless sky, this aspect is fathomed depending on form.
This what is, almsmen, the aspect of boundless cognition as base, this aspect is fathomed depending on boundless sky as base.
This what is, almsmen, the aspect of possessionlessness, this aspect is fathomed depending on boundless cognition as base.
This what is, almsmen, the aspect of neither-perception-nor-no-perception, this aspect is fathomed depending on possessionlessness as base.
This what is, almsmen, the aspect of perception of the felt, this aspect is fathomed depending on cessation.'</p>

<p>'And this what is, venerable, the aspect of light, and what is the aspect of beauty, and what is the aspect of boundless sky as base and what is the aspect of boundless cognition as base, and what is the aspect of possessionlessness as base, and what is the aspect of neither-perception-nor-no-perception as base, and what is the aspect of cessation of perception of the felt,
OK now these, venerable, the aspects, how is the engagement to be reached?' </p>

<p>'And this what is, almsman, the aspect of light, and what is the aspect of beauty, and what aspect of boundless sky as base and what is the aspect of boundless cognition as base, and what is the aspect of possessionlessness as base, 
these aspects are to be reached through engagement with perception.
This what is, almsmen, the aspect of neither-perception-nor-no-perception as base,
this aspect is to be reached through engagement with the remaining inclination.
This what is, almsmen, the aspect of cessation of perception of the felt,
this aspect is to be reached through engagement with cessation.'</p>
