<p>Situated at Sāvatthi.</p>

<p>OK then, at an occasion in the forenoon, Vajirā the almswoman having got dressed, having taken up bowl and robe, enters Sāvatthi for a lump of food.
Having walked in Sāvatthi for a lump of food, after the meal, having gone back from receiving the lump of food, she approached there where the Blind Men's Grove is for the day's dwelling. 
Having plunged into Blind Men's Grove she sat down at a certain root of a tree, the dwelling for the day.
OK then Māra the evil one approached there where the almswoman Vajirā was to arise lust, fear, the shivers, goose bumps, to drive away through lust almswoman Vajirā from concentration.
Having approached the almswoman Vajirā he talks here in verse:</p>

<p>'By whom is this, the being, made? <br>
Where is of the being the maker? <br>
Where is the being risen? <br>
Where does the being cease?'</p>

<p>OK then for Vajirā the almswoman it was like this:
OK this verse, now who talks, is it or a human or not a human?
OK then to Vajirā the almswoman it was like this:
'OK this verse, it is Māra the evil one. He talks to arise lust, fear, the shivers, goose bumps, to drive away through lust the concentration of me.'
OK then Vajirā the almswoman thus finding this Māra the evil one,
she gave a talk against the evil Māra in verses:</p>

<p>'Now what 'being' did you came on to, <br>
Māra is your view gone now? <br>
Clearly this pile of inclinations, <br>
here as inference a being is found.</p>

<p>For as with the assembly of the members, <br>
the sound is 'chariot'. <br>
So it is at the masses, <br>
a being exists in consent.</p>

<div style="page-break-after: alpaths;"></div>

<p>For just suffering appears, <br>
suffering stands and wanes. <br>
No other appears from suffering, <br>
not another ceases from suffering.' </p>

<p>OK then Māra the evil one 'The almswoman Vajirā is familiar with me' grieved, disappointed, he vanished just there.</p>
