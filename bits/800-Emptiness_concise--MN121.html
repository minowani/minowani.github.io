<p>Majjhima Nikāya <br>
Cūḷasuññatasuttaṃ <br>
MN121</p>

<p>So I learned:</p>

<p>On one occasion the exalted one dwells at the eastern park, at Migāramātupāsāda, at Sāvatthi.
OK, then senior Ānanda, on an evening occasion, returned from seclusion, approached there where the exalted one was.
Having approached the exalted one, having saluted, he sat down at one end.
OK, at one end seated, senior Ānanda said this to the exalted one:</p>

<p>'On this one occasion, venerable, the exalted one he dwells amongst the Sakyans at a market town of the Sakyans, named Nagaraka.
There I, venerable, learned in front of, received in front of, the exalted one:
'I by dwelling with emptiness, Ānanda, at present dwell a lot'.
I hope this by me, venerable, well learned, well grasped, well payed attention to, well retained?'</p>

<p>'Surely you got this, Ānanda, well learned, well grasped, well payed attention to, well retained.
I also in the prior, Ānanda, also at present, dwell at lot by dwelling with emptiness.
Also as that, Ānanda, this Migāramātupāsāda is empty of elephants, cows, horses and meres, empty of gold and silver, empty of female and male assemblies and so this exist, the non-emptiness; this what is the generalization depending on the order of almsmen.
OK just so, Ānanda, an almsmen not paying attention to the perception of village, not paying attention to the perception of men, pays attention to the generalization depending on the perception of forest.
For him at the perception of forest the mind jumps at, reconciles, coincides, attaches.
So he fathoms '<em>What might be the wearinesses depending on the perception of village, here those not exist.</em> 
<em>What might be the wearinesses depending on the perception of men, here those not exist.</em>
<em>And so this exist, the moderation of weariness; this what is the generalization depending on the perception of forest.</em>'
He fathoms '<em>This empty; from the perception of village the perception is gone</em>', 
fathoms '<em>This empty; from the perception of men the perception is gone</em>', 
'<em>And so this exist, the non-emptiness; this what is the generalization depending on the perception of forest</em>'.
OK thus for what is not there by that he sees that is empty,
yet what is left there therefor he fathoms '<em>Soothed this exists</em>'.
So also for him this is, Ānanda, being as it is, the undistorted clear entry into emptiness.</p>

<p>And further following, Ānanda, an almsmen not paying attention to the perception of men, not paying attention to the perception of forest, pays attention to the generalization depending on the perception of earth.
For him at the perception of earth the mind jumps at, reconciles, coincides, attaches.
Also as that, Ānanda, a bull's hide, well spread by a hundred pegs, is having the folds gone away,
OK just so, Ānanda, an almsmen what of this earth are the highs and lows, rivers with difficult passages, places with stumps and thorns, irregular rocks,
is not paying attention to that all; he pays attention to the generalization depending on the perception of earth.
For him at the perception of earth the mind jumps at, reconciles, coincides, attaches.
So he fathoms '<em>What might be the wearinesses depending on the perception of men here those not exist.</em>
<em>What might be the wearinesses depending on the perception of forest, here those not exist.</em>
<em>And so this exist, the moderation of weariness; this what is the generalization depending on the perception of earth.</em>'
He fathoms '<em>This empty; from the perception of men the perception is gone</em>', 
fathoms '<em>This empty; from the perception of forest the perception is gone</em>', 
'<em>And so this exist, the moderation of weariness; this what is the generalization depending on the perception of earth.</em>'
OK thus for what is not there by that he sees that is empty,
yet what is left there therefor he fathoms '<em>Soothed this exists</em>'.
So also for him this is, Ānanda, being as it is, the undistorted clear entry into emptiness. </p>

<p>And further following, Ānanda, an almsmen not paying attention to the perception of forest, not paying attention to the perception of earth, pays attention to the generalization depending on the perception of boundless sky as base.
For him at the perception of boundless sky as base the mind jumps at, reconciles, coincides, attaches.

<em>And so this exist, the moderation of weariness; this what is the generalization depending on the perception of boundless sky as base.</em>'
He fathoms '<em>This empty; from the perception of forest the perception is gone</em>', fathoms '<em>This empty; from the perception of earth the perception is gone</em>', '<em>And so this exist, the moderation of weariness; this what is the generalization depending on the perception of boundless sky as base.</em>'

<p>And further following, Ānanda, an almsmen not paying attention to the perception of boundless cognition as base, not paying attention to the perception of possessionlessness as base, pays attention to the generalization depending on the perception of neither-perception-nor-no-perception as base.
For him at the perception of neither-perception-nor-no-perception as base the mind jumps at, reconciles, coincides, attaches.

<em>And so this exist, the moderation of weariness; this what is the generalization depending on the perception of neither-perception-nor-no-perception as base.</em>'

So also for him this is, Ānanda, being as it is, the undistorted clear entry into emptiness.</p>

<p>And further following, Ānanda, an almsmen not paying attention to the perception of possessionlessness as base, not paying attention to the perception of neither-perception-nor-no-perception as base, pays attention to the generalization depending on the absence of indication mental-concentration.

<em>What might be the wearinesses depending on the perception of neither-perception-nor-no-perception as base, here those not exist.</em>
<em>And so this exist, the moderation of weariness; this what is just this body depending on the hexad-base support for life</em>'.
He fathoms '<em>This empty; from the perception of possessionlessness as base the perception is gone</em>', fathoms '<em>This empty; from the perception of neither-perception-nor-no-perception as base the perception is gone</em>', 
'<em>And so this exist, the non-emptiness; this what is just this body depending on the hexad-base support for life.</em>'

So he fathoms '<em>OK also this absence of indication mental-concentration is arranged, intended</em>',
fathoms '<em>OK yet anything what is arranged, intended, that is unstable; the principle of cessation</em>'.
For him thus from knowing, thus from seeing, and the mind emancipated from the drain of lust, and the mind emancipated from the drain of becoming, and the minded emancipated from the drain of not knowing,
upon emancipation, thus emancipated, the knowledge is. 
He fathoms '<em>Birth is barren, the clergy conduct spent, done is what ought to be done, no more earning of presence</em>'.
So he fathoms '<em>What might be the wearinesses depending on the drain of lust, here those not exist.</em>
<em>What might be the wearinesses depending on the drain of becoming, here those not exist.</em>
<em>What might be the wearinesses depending on the drain of not knowing, here those not exist.</em>

yet what is left there therefor he fathoms '<em>Soothed this exists</em>'.
So also for him this is, Ānanda, being as it is, the undistorted clean, furthest, without a beyond, entry into emptiness.</p>

<p>Also for whatever, Ānanda, in past durations, or recluses or clergymen obtaining the clean, the furthest, without a beyond, emptiness, they all dwelt obtaining just this clean, furthest, without a beyond, emptiness.
Also what for, Ānanda, in durations not yet come, or recluses or clergymen, obtaining the clean, the furthest, without a beyond, emptiness, they all will dwell obtaining just this clean, furthest, without a beyond, emptiness.
Also what for, Ānanda, at present, or recluses or clergymen, obtaining the clean, the furthest, without a beyond, emptiness, they all dwell obtaining just this clean, furthest, without a beyond, emptiness.
Therefore, Ānanda, 'We shall dwell obtaining the clean, the furthest, without a beyond, emptiness'
for so by you guys, Ānanda, it should be trained.'</p>
