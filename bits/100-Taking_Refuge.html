<p>Everyone thinks they are right, there is no one thinking they are wrong. When it turned out later you were wrong, you are then now right about being then wrong. And even if you think ‘This action is bad, I shouldn’t be doing this’ it is mere a double right: you already know it is a bad action so you are right about that, and for some reason it is still the right thing for you to do so now.</p>

<p>Basically you can’t do things which on all levels are seen by you as wrong, which is already covered by the words right and wrong which do have some relation to you. We can’t directly see our wrong view but we can try to understand it indirectly f.i. with the thought: ‘I am not awakened therefore I must have wrong view’ however, this comes from taking up that view as right first; so you are then still, first right. Things are thus met with certain blindfolds on; they are in a blind corner and are not seen.</p>

<p>Taking refuge is basically resorting to another one’s proclamation to see what is more true; it is like using mirrors to be able to see what is in your blind spot. When some asks in how far a principle is in agreement with science, it usually shows their refuge lies foremost in science. Or when concerned whether it is confirm their school, foremost their school. And refuge to the awakened one does have its own problems, for the question remains ‘Which awakened one?’ Some say the texts, within and across schools, are in contradiction, some argue it is all the same, in any case when taking refuge you still already decided what you hold as true first. A safer approach then is to investigate what you hold as true and then go by what you 'understand to be true for yourself'. Without accepting and denying things you don’t understand, else you would just imply you do understand which just shows where your refuge lies foremost. It can be handy not to take to big chunks all at once but to work with smaller steps; the more you work with what you really know the deeper and wider your understanding grows. Till someday you can be your own refuge without the blindfolds on.</p>
