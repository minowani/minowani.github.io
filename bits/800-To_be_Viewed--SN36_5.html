<p>'These three, almsmen, feelings.
Which three?
Feelings of happiness, feelings of suffering, feelings of neither happiness nor suffering.</p>

<p>Feelings of happiness, almsmen, are to be viewed as from suffering;
feelings of suffering are to be viewed as from a spike;
feelings of neither happiness nor suffering are to be viewed as from unstableness.</p>

<p>OK from what, almsmen, to an almsman the feeling of happiness is it is viewed as from suffering; 
the feeling of suffering is viewed as from a spike;
the feeling of neither happiness nor suffering is viewed as from unstableness.
This is called, almsmen, 
an almsman who rightly viewed. 
He cut out longing, turned down the yoke, by the right comprehension of esteem he made an end of suffering.' </p>

<p><em>What is happiness he did view from suffering,</em> <br>
<em>suffering he did view from a spike;</em> <br>
<em>neither happiness nor suffering existing he did view from unstableness;</em> <br>
<em>surely he, the almsman who rightly viewed, understands feelings.</em> </p>

<p><em>He, the feelings understanding,</em> <br>
<em>had viewed, in principle, the drainlessness;</em> <br>
<em>after the breaking up of the body, the principle set;</em> <br>
<em>having the revelation, he can not come to reckoning.</em></p>
