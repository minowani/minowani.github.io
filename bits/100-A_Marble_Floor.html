<h3 class="nav">A Marble Floor</h3>
<p>Suppose a friend is helping you cleaning your new house. When you head to the store for some supplies your friend starts with the hallway floor. It is an old nice looking marble floor, and after the mopping your friend takes a break.</p>

<p>When you return, and start to clean the same floor, your friend tells you that they had clean it already. But when you explain that the marble is actually white, and what was taken as the pattern was in fact dirt, your friend might look at it differently. Especially after seeing that with the proper cleaning tools these "patterns" do indeed come off. So now your friend understands what should have be done, right? When they didn't see the floor as white there was no problem seen in leaving the stains as they were. </p>

<p>It is the same with the mind really. In Aṅguttara Nikāya 1.51-52 we find these two texts: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>'This shining, almsmen, mind. OK and that stained from visiting stains, that not having learned the commoner essentially does not fathom. From that not having learned, I say 'cultivation of mind does not exist for the commoner'.'</p>

<p>'This shining, almsmen, mind. OK and that liberated from visiting stains, that having learned the hearer of what is noble essentially does fathom. From that having learned, I say 'cultivation of mind does exist for the hearer of what is noble'.'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So in this way it is not a statement about the mind being beautiful as it is, perfect in its nature, that it only needs to be observed, or anything like that. A clean floor is still a floor. With the dirty floor it was about not seeing dirt as dirt and thus lacking the knowledge, effort, skill, interest, to attain to the job of cleansing.</p>
