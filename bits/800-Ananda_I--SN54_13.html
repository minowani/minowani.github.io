<p>At Sāvatthi.</p>

<p>OK, then senior Ānanda approached there where the exalted one was.
Having approached the exalted one, having saluted, he sat down at one end.
OK, at one end seated senior Ānanda said this to the exalted one:</p>

<p>'OK now does it exist, venerable, one principle, when cultivated, when made a lot of, pours over into four principles,
four principles, when cultivated, when made much of, pour over into seven principles,
seven principles, when cultivated, when made much of, pour over into two principles?'</p>

<p>'OK it does exist, Ānanda, one principle, when cultivated, when made a lot of, pours over into four principles, four principles, when cultivated, when made a lot of, pour over into seven principles, seven principles, when cultivated, when made a lot of, pour over into two principles.'</p>

<p>'Yet which, venerable, one principle, when cultivated, when made a lot of, pours over into four principles, four principles, when cultivated, when made a lot of, pour over into seven principles, seven principles when cultivated, when made a lot of pour over into two principles?'</p>

<p>'OK, concentration from meditation on the in breathe and out breathe, Ānanda, is one principle, when cultivated, when made a lof of, pours over into the four attendances of meditation, 
the four attendances of meditation, when cultivated, when made a lot of, pour over into the seven members of enlightenment,
the seven members of enlightenment, when cultivated, when made a lot of, pour over into knowledge and emancipation.</p>

<p><em>Cultivated how, Ānanda, made much of how, does concentration from meditation on the in breathe and out breathe pour over into the four attendances of meditation?</em></p>

<p>Here Ānanda, an almsman, gone to a forest or gone to the root of a tree, or gone to an empty home, having folded a seat he sits down, directing the body straight, peripherally attending the meditation.</p>

<p>He either meditative breathes in, <br>
or meditative breathes out.</p>

<p>Or while breathing in long fathoms 'long, I'll breathe in', <br>
... <br>
trains ’while looking into relinquishment, I'll breathe out’.</p>

<p>On what occasion, Ānanda, an almsman or while breathing in long fathoms 'long, I'll breathe in' ...
trains 'while calming inclinations for body, I'll breathe out'
he is looking into body, Ānanda, the almsman on that occasion dwells in body as the ardent aware meditator would be disciplining the avarice and distress about the world.</p>

<p>Of what is this the reason?</p>

<p>I say this is a certain body, Ānanda, this what is the breathing in and the breathing out.
Thus from that, Ānanda, looking into body an almsman on that occasion dwells in body as the ardent aware meditator would be disciplining the avarice and distress about the world.</p>

<p>On what occasion, Ānanda, an almsman trains 'while experiencing pleasantness, I'll breathe in' ...
trains 'while calming inclinations for mind I'll breathe out'.
he is looking into feelings, Ānanda, the almsman on that occasion dwells in feelings as the ardent aware meditator would be disciplining the avarice and distress about the world.</p>

<p>Of what is this the reason?</p>

<p>I say this is a certain feeling, Ānanda, this what is the in breathe and out breathe when well payed attention to.
Thus from that, Ānanda, looking into feelings an almsman on that occasion dwells in feelings as the ardent aware meditator would be disciplining the avarice and distress about the world.</p>

<p>On what occasion, Ānanda, an almsman trains 'while experiencing mind, I'll breathe in' ...
trains 'while emancipating mind, I'll breathe out'
he is looking into mind, Ānanda, the almsman on that occasion dwells in mind as the ardent aware meditator would be disciplining the avarice and distress about the world.</p>

<p>Of what is this the reason?</p>

<p>I do not say of the cultivation of the concentration from meditation on the in breathe and out breathe the meditation is forgotten, without awareness.
Therefore, Ānanda, looking into mind an almsman on that occasion dwells in mind as the ardent aware meditator would be disciplining the avarice and distress about the world.</p>

<p>On what occasion, Ānanda, an almsman trains 'while looking into unstableness, I'll breathe in' ... 
trains 'while looking into relinquishment, I'll breathe out'
he is looking into principles, Ānanda, the almsman on that occasion dwells in principles as the ardent aware meditator would be disciplining the avarice and distress about the world.
Therefor what this, the rejection of the avarice and distress, is, for knowing, viewing, it well it is therefor here objectivated.
Therefore Ānanda, looking into principles an almsman on that occasion dwells in principles as the ardent aware meditator would be disciplining the avarice and distress about the world.</p>

<p>OK, cultivated so, made a lot of so, Ānanda, concentration from meditation on the in breathe and out breathe pours over into the four attendances of meditation.</p>

<p><em>And cultivated how, Ānanda, made a lot of how do the four attendances for meditation pour over into the seven members of enlightenment?</em></p>

<p>On what occasion, Ānanda, an almsman looking into body dwells in body
on that occasion for the almsman the attended meditation is not forgotten.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On what occasion, Ānanda, for the almsman the attended meditation is not forgotten,
on that occasion for the almsman meditation as member of enlightenment is started.
On that occasion the almsman cultivates meditation as member of enlightenment.

</blockquote>

<p>Like that he, the meditative dweller, for knowing the principle therefor investigates, inspects, scrutinizes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On what occasion, Ānanda, an almsman, like that meditative dweller for knowing the principle therefor investigates, inspects, scrutinizes,

</blockquote>

<p>Therefor for him for knowing the principle, by investigation, by inspection, by scrutinizing, without sluggishness, vigour is started.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On what occasion, Ānanda, therefor for the almsman for knowing the principle, by investigation, by inspection, by scrutinizing, without sluggishness, vigour is started,

</blockquote>

<p>Of the started vigour arises pleasantness not of the flesh.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The contentment calms also the body, calms also the mind.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On what occasion, Ānanda, for the almsman the contentment calms also the body, calms also the mind,
on that occasion for the almsman calmness as member of enlightenment is started.
On that occasion the almsman cultivates calmness as member of enlightenment.
On that occasion for the almsman calmness as member of enlightenment goes on pouring over by cultivation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For with calmness of body, the happy mind concentrates.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On what occasion, Ānanda, for the almsman with calmness of body the happy mind concentrates,
on that occasion for the almsman concentration as member of enlightenment is started.
On that occasion the almsman cultivates concentration as member of enlightenment.

</blockquote>

<p>Well concentrated like that, that mind is here objectivated.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On what occasion, Ānanda, the almsman is well concentrated like that, mind is here objectivated,
on that occasion for the almsman objectivity as member of enlightenment is started.
On that occasion the almsman cultivates objectivity as member of enlightenment.
On that occasion for the almsman objectivity as member of enlightenment goes on pouring over by cultivation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>... feelings ... mind ... principles ...</em></p>

<p>OK cultivated so, Ānanda, made a lot of so, the four attendances of meditation pour over into the seven members of enlightenment.</p>

<p><em>Cultivated how, Ānanda, made a lot of how, do the seven members of enlightenment pour over into knowing and emancipation?</em></p>

<p>Here, Ānanda, an almsman 
cultivates meditation ... discernment of principles ... vigour ... pleasantness ... calmness ... concentration ... objectivity as a member of enlightenment relying on withdrawal, relying on fading, relying on cessation, resulting in waivering.</p>

<p>OK cultivated so, Ānanda, made a lot of so, the seven members of enlightenment pour over into knowledge and emancipation.'</p>
