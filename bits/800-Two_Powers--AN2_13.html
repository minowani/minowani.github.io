<p>Aṅguttara Nikāya <br>

<p>'These two, almsmen, powers.</p>

<p>Which two?</p>

<p>And the power of calculation and the power of cultivation.</p>

<p>And which, almsmen, power of calculation?</p>

<p>Here, almsmen, someone thus regularly reflects:</p>

<p>'OK for behaving badly by body, evil ripening is viewed and like in principle and along the nearby and further.
OK for behaving badly by speech, evil ripening is viewed and like in principle and along the nearby and further.
OK for behaving badly by intellect, evil ripening is viewed and like in principle and along the nearby and further.'</p>

<p>Thus he is calculating,
giving up behaving badly by body cultivates behaving well by body,
giving up behaving badly by speech cultivates behaving well by speech,
giving up behaving badly by intellect cultivates behaving well by intellect;
he maintains himself cleanly.</p>

<p>This is called, almsmen, the power of calculation.</p>

<p>And which, almsmen, power of cultivation?</p>

<p>Here, almsmen, an almsmen is just withdrawing from lusts,
withdrawing from unwholesome principles, 
with thoughts with thinking, withdrawal-borne the pleasantness and happiness, he dwells having obtained the first radiance.</p>

<p>From the ease of thoughts and thinking, inner serenity, determination of mind, without thoughts without thinking, concentration-borne the pleasantness and happiness, he dwells having obtained the second radiance.</p>

<p>And from the pleasantness fading he dwells and objective and meditative, aware, and the happiness with the body he does experience,
that what nobles disclose:
'An objective meditator, a happy dweller',
he dwells having obtained the third radiance.</p>

<p>And from the rejection of happiness and from the rejection of suffering, from the settling down of the just prior contentment and distress, neither happily nor sufferingly, pure objective the meditation,
he dwells having obtained the fourth radiance.</p>

<p>This is called, almsmen, the power of cultivation.</p>

<p>OK these, almsmen, two powers.'</p>
