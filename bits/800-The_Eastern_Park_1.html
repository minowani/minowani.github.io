<p>So I learned:</p>

<p>On one occasion the exalted one dwells at the eastern park Migāramātupāsāda, at Sāvatthi.
OK, there the exalted one addressed the almsmen:</p>

<p>'OK now, almsmen, from the cultivation, making a lot of, of how many strengths, the drains barren, an almsman answers another:
'I know birth is barren, the clergy behaviour is fulfiled, done is what ought to be done, no more earning of presence'?'</p>

<p>'Our principles are, venerable, rooted in the exalted one, guided by the exalted, have the exalted one as resort. 
As good custom, venerable, may the exalted one just so illuminate the settlement of this talk.
Having learned it from the exalted one, the almsmen will endorse it.'</p>

<p>'OK, almsmen, from the cultivation, from making a lot of, of one strength, the drains barren, an almsman answers another:
'I know birth is barren, the clergy behaviour is fulfiled, done is what ought to be done, no more earning of presence.'
Of which one? 
Of the strength of wisdom; from wisdom, almsmen, for the hearer of what is noble the confirmation is then accordingly established,
vigour is then accordingly established, recollection is then accordingly established, concentration is then accordingly established.
OK for this, almsmen, from the cultivation, making a lot of, of one strength, the drains barren, an almsman answers another:
'I know birth is barren, the clergy behaviour is fulfiled, done is what ought to be done, no more earning of presence'.'</p>
