<p>We don’t need to consult many buddhist texts to read that according to them death is not the end of it all. Were it so a knife would then already have been a far more easier tool. Rebirth and reincarnation don’t have this problem but share the idea that a certain something is carried over, or remains, from one life to another and that is there the problem.</p>

<p>Eternalism (<em>sassatavādā</em>) and nihilism (<em>ucchedavādā</em>) are the two worldly views on existence. Eternalism opposes nihilism and must first hold time as never ending (eternal). The breaking up, disintegration, perishing, of the existing-through-time, the here not forever part, is what nihilism is. And both rebirth and reincarnation are based on these misconceptions. Though used as argument against nihilsm, existence through time until no more is really just a delayed nihilsm.  </p>

<p>Now for something you have never experienced, heard of, etc. you have no name. So if you do have a name it is for a certain experience, but when this is misunderstood the name includes the misunderstanding. Things can be remembered (SN22.79), thought out, perceived, yet misunderstood. Rebirth and reincarnation do not just indicate life after dead they must also include a certain how. And depending on this how these views can be seen different or as synonyms, but what these outsiders’ views didn’t include is dependent-co-arising.</p>

<p>— If rebirth and reincarnation were to be redefined to imply dependent-co-arising (a buddhist version of rebirth or reincarnation? Why such horrible construct) it would still solve nothing. Rooted in wrong view they don’t disentangle anything but build further on top what is not understood, it added another concept to the confusion thus requiring more explanation not less. Just as with eating; it doesn’t matter how often you eat it stays eating (eating is eating). You wouldn’t then suddenly re-eat, which would then require more explanation, not less (is it like what cows do?) So this redefinition engraves and masquerades the already underlying wrong views which now forms support for pernicious explanations like dependent-co-arsing with lifetimes. But dependent-co-arising explained as existing through time (across lifetimes, rebirth) still stays to be <em>sassatavādā</em> &amp; <em>ucchedavādā</em>.</p>

<p>With rebirth and reincarnation beings are seen as reborn or reincarnated, in any case beings are born. Both views, each a view on embodiment (<em>sakkāyadiṭṭhi</em>), must at least acknowledge birth. And it is precisely birth which is not being understood. The texts themselves talk about birth, next birth, a following existence, etc. and translations as rebirth and reincarnation are just translational liberties. Unlike them birth is not just a view, birth already includes the possibility for a next birth (birth is birth) for it too is dependently-co-arisen. Thus the usage of birth, next birth, future birth, further existence, etc. will do perfectly fine. There is no need to seek shelter in wrong views; two wrongs don't make a right.</p>

<p>The world fares towards opposite sides (eternalism, nihilism). It was the Tathāgata who taught by the middle, and the middle simply can not be grouped with either side.</p>
