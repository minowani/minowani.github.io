<p>'OK now, almsmen, when exists what, taking it up, settling into what, does such view arises:</p>

<p>'Not exists, the given. Not exists, the sacrificed.
Not exists, the offered. 
Not exists, fruitfully ripening of well done and badly done actions.
Not exists, this world.
Not exists, the other world.
Not exists, mother. Not exists, father.
Not exists, beings from spontaneous attainment.
Not exists, recluses and clergymen in the world, having gone rightly, having followed rightly, confirming what is and this world and the other world.
This man is of four great essences, when he does his time, 
earth forwards along, goes down along, the body of earth;
water forwards along, goes down along, the body of water;
fire forwards along, goes down along, the body of fire;
air forwards along, goes down along, the body of air;
the strengths join space.
With the bier as fifth the men, having received the death one, they go.
They are to be fathomed as far as the cemetery grounds.
Pale bones they have become.
The offerings crumbled;
this what is a gift, the stupid declared.
For those vain, falsely, idle, theories of existence they say whatever;
and the fool, and the wise, from the breaking up of the body are annihilated, they perish; from death they are no further'?'</p>

<p>'Our principles are, venerable, rooted in the exalted one, guided by the exalted, have the exalted one as resort. As good custom, venerable, may the exalted one just so illuminate the settlement of this talk. Having learned from the exalted one the almsmen will endorse it.’</p>

<p>'OK when form, almsmen, exists, taking it up as form,
settling into form, such view arises: 
<em>'Not exists, the given ... from death they are no further.'</em>
<em>... feeling ... perception ... inclinations ... cognition ...</em></p>

<p>OK what is it that you deem, almsmen, is form or stable or unstable?'</p>

<p>'Unstable, venerable.'</p>

<p>'What is yet unstable, is that or sufferingly or happily?'</p>

<p>'Sufferingly, venerable.'</p>

<p>'What is yet unstable, sufferingly, the principle for change,
therefor also now without taking it up, would such view arise:
<em>'Not exists, the given .... from death they are no further'</em>?'</p>

<p>'Of course not, venerable.'</p>

<p><em>... feeling ... perception ... inclinations ... cognition ...</em></p>

<p>Also this what is the view, learned, deemed, cognized, reached, searched, thought out by the intellect, is that also or stable or unstable?</p>

<p>'Unstable, venerable.'</p>

<p>'What is yet unstable, is that or sufferingly or happily?'</p>

<p>'Sufferingly, venerable.'</p>

<p>'What is yet unstable, sufferingly, the principle for change,
therefor now also without taking it up, would such view arise:
<em>'Not exists, the given .... from death they are no further'</em>?'</p>

<p>'Of course not, venerable.'</p>

<p>'OK from what, almsmen, for the hearer of what is noble, and the doubt about these standings is given up,
the doubt also about suffering is given up,
the doubt also about the path heading to the cessation of suffering is given up.
This is called, almsmen, the hearer of what is noble, the stream-undergoer, bound to the principle without a downfall, with enlightenment as final goal.</p>
