<h3 class="nav">Perfections</h3>
<p>Ever so now and then I hear about "the perfections" (<em>pāramī</em>) and I would like to make a general remark.</p>

<p>Hearing about "the perfections" some may feel they then understand what needs to be done. However when one understands what needs to be done then one underwent the stream, till then things are not quite so understood. Now more things are not clear till they are but a perfection has a ring to it of something pretty much flawless from each and every angle, or maxed-out; something quite out of reach. If you need to judge your own actions along what you consider to be perfect then it is seldom good enough.</p>

<p>To them I would emphasize the words good enough. Good enough for the goal gives some more room, air, right? Your behaviour does not have to be perfect, just good enough. Your concentration does not have to be perfect, just good enough. Your wisdom does not have to be perfect, just good enough.</p>

<p>This is not just a trick to get some air in. The <em>pāramī</em> are not found in the four <em>Nikāyā</em>, and in these texts we do see virtuous ones (<em>arahants</em>) behaving in a way which others saw as rude or careless etc. So to others it did not look like the perfect behaviour at all. We also see the virtuous ones differ in concentration. Some had supernatural abilities, others not, yet their concentration was developed good enough. Likewise there were differences in wisdom, yet the developed wisdom was good enough to uproot not knowing. Those cultivations were of a much higher degree than what is needed to undergo the stream for which less behaviour, less concentration and less wisdom are good enough. In any case, when good enough, well... that is just perfect.</p>
