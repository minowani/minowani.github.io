<p>'I shall point out, almsmen, old and new action, cessation of action, and heading for the cessation of action the path.
Hear that, pay attention well, I shall talk.</p>

<p>And which is, almsmen, old action?</p>

<p>Eye, almsmen, is to be viewed as old action; arranged, intended, to be felt. 
<em>Ear... Nose... Tongue... Body...</em>
<em>Intellect...</em>
This is called, almsmen, old action. </p>

<p>And which is, almsmen, new action? </p>

<p>OK what, almsmen, action one does at present by body, by speech, by intellect.
This is called, almsmen, new action.</p>

<p>And which is, almsmen, cessation of action? </p>

<p>OK what, almsmen, emancipation one touches by cessation of action by body, of action by speech, of action by intellect.
This is called, almsmen, cessation of action.</p>

<p>And which is, almsmen, the path heading for the cessation of action?</p>

<p>Just this noble eightfold way viz. right view, right attitude, right speech, right doing, right way of life, right effort, right recollection, right concentration. This is called, almsmen, the path heading for the cessation of action.</p>

<p>OK thus, almsmen, is by me pointed out old action, pointed out new action, pointed out cessation of action, pointed out the path heading for the cessation of action. </p>

<p>OK what, almsmen, should be done by a predecessor for the welfare of hearers, picking it up with mercy, out of mercy, that is done by me for you. 
These are, almsmen, roots of trees, these are empty homes; 
radiate, almsmen, don't be negligent, don't become regretful afterwards. 
This is our instruction to you.'</p>
