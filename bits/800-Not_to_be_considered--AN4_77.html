<p>'These four, almsman, are not what would be considered; they not should be considered.
Who is a considerator of this is a shareholder of madness, of vexation. </p>

<p>Which four?</p>

<p>For the ones awakened, almsmen, the realm of awakening is not what would be considered; it not should be considered.
Who is a considerator of this is a shareholder of madness, of vexation.</p>

<p>For the ones radiating, almsmen, the realm of radiance is not what would be considered; it not should be considered.
Who is a considerator of this is a shareholder of madness, of vexation.</p>

<p>The ripening the action has, almsman, is not what would be considered; it not should be considered.
Who is a considerator of this is a shareholder of madness, of vexation.</p>

<p>Considerations about the world, almsmen, are not what would be considered; it not should be considered.
Who is a considerator of this, is a shareholder of madness, of vexation.</p>

<p>OK these, almsmen, four are not what would be considered; they not should be considered.
Who is a considerator of this, is a shareholder of madness, of vexation.'</p>
