<h3 class="nav">Letting Go</h3>
<p>Very often it can be heard one should not attach; one should let go.</p>

<p>I am not to found of this letting-go. Not that we should not let go, but without proper understanding I find it not to be to helpful. Often a very rigid letting-go is viewed. While there is the case were it can also be seen as <em>no worries</em>, <em>relax</em>, <em>just let it go</em>, which already make things lighter. </p>

<p>Perhaps a more beneficial approach is not to take it as an instruction but seeing it as a result from developing understanding. The more wisdom is developed the more letting-go will naturally follow. But it can work as a reminder. Before engaging or when separation sets in it can be handy to remind yourself it might not be worth the trouble to hang on to things-that-follow-their-own-agenda to such an extend they will cost you your own happiness. Letting your happiness depend on things you don’t have control over might not be the wisest thing to do.</p>

<p>This letting-go is not seen as a form of a negative mood or so, quite the contrary. After all it is really about the letting go of greed, hate and delusion and thus is there then more room for kindness, generosity, compassion, etc. So just keep it light (loose) instead of heavy (attached). Be wise about it. Let it go ... <em>free</em>.</p>
