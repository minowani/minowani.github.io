<p>Situated at Sāvatthi.  </p>

<p>OK, there ... said this:  </p>

<p>'One principle, almsmen, when cultivated, when made a lot of, is great of fruit, great of benefit.
Which one principle?  </p>

<p>Recollection on the in and out breathe.  </p>

<p>And from cultivated how, almsmen, from made a lot of how, is the recollection on the in and out breathe great of fruit, great of benefit?</p>

<p>Here, almsmen, an almsman gone to a forest or gone to the root of a tree, or gone to an empty home, 
having folded a seat he sits down, directing the body straight, peripherally attending the recollection.</p>

<p>He either recollected breathes in, or recollected breathes out.</p>

<p>Either while breathing in long he knows: 'long I breathe in', <br>
or while breathing out long he knows: 'long I breathe out'. <br>
Either while breathing in short he knows: 'short I breathe in', <br>
or while breathing out short he knows: 'short I breathe out'.   </p>

<p>'While experiencing the whole body I shall breathe in' he trains himself, <br>
'while experiencing the whole body I shall breathe out' he trains himself.  </p>

<p>'While calming the inclinations for the body I shall breathe in' he trains himself, <br>
'while calming the inclinations for the body I shall breathe out' he trains himself.  </p>

<p>'While experiencing pleasantness I breathe in' he trains himself, <br>
'while experiencing pleasantness I breathe out' he trains himself.  </p>

<p>'While experiencing happiness I breathe in' he trains himself, <br>
'while experiencing happiness I breathe out' he trains himself.  </p>

<p>'While experiencing the inclinations for the mind I breathe in' he trains himself, <br>
'while experiencing the inclinations for the mind I breathe out' he trains himself.  </p>

<p>'While calming the inclinations for the mind I breathe in' he trains himself, <br>
'while calming the inclinations for the mind I breathe out' he trains himself.  </p>

<p>'While experiencing the mind I breathe in' he trains himself, <br>
'while experiencing the mind I breathe out' he trains himself.  </p>

<p>'While concentrating the mind I breathe in' he trains himself, <br>
'while concentrating the mind I breathe out' he trains himself.  </p>

<p>'While emancipating the mind I breathe in' he trains himself, <br>
'while emancipating the mind I breathe out' he trains himself.  </p>

<p>'While looking at unstableness I breathe in' he trains himself, <br>
'while looking at unstableness I breathe out' he trains himself.  </p>

<p>'While looking at fading I breathe in' he trains himself, <br>
'while looking at fading I breathe out' he trains himself.  </p>

<p>'While looking at cessation I breathe in' he trains himself, <br>
'while looking at cessation I breathe out' he trains himself.  </p>

<p>'While looking at renunciation I breathe in' he trains himself, <br>
'while looking at renunciation I breathe out' he trains himself.  </p>

<p>OK when cultivated so, almsmen, when made a lot of so, the recollection on the in and out breathe is great of fruit, great of benefit.'</p>
