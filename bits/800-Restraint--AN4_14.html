<p>'These four, almsmen, efforts.</p>

<p>Which four?</p>

<ol>
<li>effort of restraint.</li>
<li>effort of rejection.</li>
<li>effort of cultivation.</li>
<li>effort of preservation.</li>
</ol>

<p>And which, almsmen, effort of restraint?</p>

<p>Here, almsmen, an almsman, viewing form by eye, is not a holder of indications, not a holder of details,
by reason of which there to, the strength of the eye abiding unrestrained, he would befall to avarice and distress, evil, unwholesome principles.
To restrain that he goes against, he guards against, the strength of the eye. The strength of the eye undergoes the restraint.
Hearing a sound by ear ... Smelling a scent by nose ... Tasting a taste by tongue ... Touching a tangible by body ... Cognizing a principle by intellect ...
This is called, almsmen, effort of restraint.</p>

<p>And which, almsmen, effort of rejection?</p>

<p>Here, almsmen, an almsman not endures, gives up, dispels, destroys, annihilates arisen lustful thoughts 
... arisen angry thoughts ... arisen harmful thoughts ... whichever arisen evil, unwholesome principles. 
This is called, almsmen, effort of rejection.</p>

<p>And which, almsmen, effort of cultivation?</p>

<p>Here, almsmen, an almsman cultivates meditation as member of enlightenment, relying on withdrawal, relying on fading, relying on cessation, resulting in waivering. 
discernment of principles as member of enlightenment ... vigour as member of enlightenment ... pleasantness as member of enlightenment ... calmness as member of enlightenment ... concentration as member of enlightenment ... objectivity as member of enlightenment ...
This is called, almsmen, effort of cultivation.</p>

<p>And which, almsmen, effort of preservation? </p>

<p>Here, almsmen, an almsman preserves an arisen suitable indication of concentration: the perception of a skeleton, the perception of a maggot infested cadaver, the perception of a discoloured cadaver, the perception of a festering cadaver, the perception of a fissured cadaver, the perception of a bloated cadaver. 
This is called, almsmen, effort of preservation.</p>

<p>OK these, almsmen, are the four efforts.'</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>'And restraint and rejection, cultivation, preservation</em> <br>
<em>these four efforts are pointed out by the Kinsman of the Sun</em> <br>
<em>by which the here ardent almsman</em> <br>
<em>ought to reach the barrenness of suffering'</em> </p>
</blockquote>
