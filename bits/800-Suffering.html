<p>At Sāvatthi ...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>'Of suffering, almsmen, I shall point out and the rise, and the settling down.
Hear that, pay attention well, I shall talk.'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OK, so those almsmen replied to the exalted one:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>'Venerable' </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The exalted one said this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>'And which is, almsmen, of suffering the rise? </p>

<p>Depending on and eye and forms arises eye-cognition. 
The going together of the three is the touch.
With support of touch, feeling. With support of feeling, longing. 
OK this, almsmen, is of suffering the rise.
Depending on and ear and sounds arises ear-cognition ... and nose and scents ... and tongue and tastes ... and body and to be touched ... and intellect and principles arises intellect-cognition. 
The going together of the three is the touch.
With support of touch, feeling. With support of feeling, longing. 
OK this, almsmen, is of suffering the rise. </p>

<p>And which is, almsmen, of suffering the settling down?</p>

<p>Depending on and eye and forms, arises eye-cognition.
The going together of the three is the touch.
With support of touch, feeling. With support of feeling, longing. 
With complete fading and cessation, just from that longing, cessation of taking up.
With cessation of taking up, cessation of existence. With cessation of existence, cessation of birth. With cessation of birth, ageing-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, suffering, distress, unrest cease.
So for this entire mass of suffering the cessation is.
OK this, almsmen, is of suffering the settling down. <br>
