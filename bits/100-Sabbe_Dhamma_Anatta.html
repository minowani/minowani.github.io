<blockquote>
  <p><em>Sabbe saṅkhārā aniccā</em> <br>
<em>Sabbe saṅkhārā dukkhā</em> <br>
<em>Sabbe dhammā anattā</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>A common explanation is that since the third line talks about <em>dhammā</em>, instead of <em>saṅkhārā</em>, it includes both <em>saṅkhārā</em> and <em>asaṅkhārā</em>. And <em>nibbāna</em>, being <em>asaṅkhārā</em>, is thus included. But is this a valid inference?</p>

<p>One who underwent the stream has understood <em>anattā</em>, then the last line is clear. Till then <em>anattā</em> is misunderstood (idem the others). To come to understand <em>anattā</em> we need to train. And what is there to train? In this context we can look at SN22.15 where is said that masses (<em>khandhā</em>) are unstable (<em>anicca</em>). And what is unstable is suffering (<em>dukkha</em>). What is suffering is not self (<em>anattā</em>) and should be seen with wisdom as it really is: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self (<em>attā</em>)’. Which leads to getting fed up and with being fed up comes fading. Through fading, emancipation and with emancipation there is that knowledge.</p>

<p>That the masses are unstable is here a given, a statement; it is here not explained. In order to understand we need to learn to see for ourselves how this is so, which requires a thorough grasping of their principle. When we understand the principle of f.i. matter, we can even say something about matter which we have never ever encountered before. And to look at this principle we need to look for, investigate, a more general level. What do all manifestations of matter have in common? That what it is, is then its characteristic and all matter behave accordingly. Thus when wood is understood then to that extend all wooden things are understood. Likewise, when <em>saṅkhārā</em> are understood (as unstable) then all <em>dhammā</em> are understood (as not self). And that is what those three lines say. This way they can be seen as a very compact instruction.</p>

<p>But would that rule out <em>nibbāna</em>?</p>

<p>By implying <em>nibbāna</em> as being included, it must also imply unstableness (<em>anattā</em> is seen because unstableness is seen) and with unstableness suffering, which simply can’t be. The line '<em>sabbe dhammā anattā</em>' does not justify making such (<em>atta</em> or <em>anattā</em>) claims about the <em>asaṅkhāta</em> at all.</p>
