<p>'These three, almsmen, feelings. 
Which three?
Feelings of happiness, feelings of suffering, feelings of neither happiness nor suffering.</p>

<p>Feelings of happiness, almsmen, are to be viewed as from suffering,
feelings of suffering are to be viewed as from a spike, 
feelings of neither happiness nor suffering, are to be viewed as from unstableness.</p>

<p>OK from what, almsmen, to an almsman the feeling of happiness is it is viewed as from suffering, 
the feeling of suffering is viewed as from a spike,
the feeling of neither happiness nor suffering is viewed as from unstableness.
This is called, almsmen, 
an almsmen having the right view.
He cut out longing, turned down the yoke, by rightly acquainting esteem he made an end of suffering.' </p>

<p><em>What is happiness he did view from suffering, suffering he did view from a spike,</em> <br>
<em>neither happiness nor suffering being, he did view from unstableness,</em> <br>
<em>he surely is an almsmen having the right view, he understands feelings.</em> </p>

<p><em>He, the feelings understanding, viewed in principle the drainless,</em> <br>
<em>after the breaking up of the body, the principle set,</em> <br>
<em>having gone through the highest knowledge, he can not come to reckoning.</em></p>
