<p><em>Dhamma</em> can be found translated as norm, law, nature, law of nature, teaching, doctrine, phenomena, qualities ...</p>

<p>Translations for <em>dhamma</em> can sometimes be found in glossaries yet they may not get used in the texts themselves that way; this tends to make things a bit abstract and unclear. It can also have different translations in texts or be omitted which makes it not directly recognizable either, but it is just a word which would be ordinarily used by ordinarily people. By making it vague it is so abstract any-thing might do, yes even a thing.</p>

<p>And what makes a thing a thing? What is the thing-ness in thing? If you ponder on this you might perhaps find that this thing-ness is based on a 'blueprint', a law, nature... so thus a <em>principle</em>. And that is what <em>dhamma</em> means; principle. The teaching is a <em>principle</em>; a teaching is based on principles, it teaches principles. Law of nature; a <em>principle</em>. A basic truth; a <em>principle</em>. The essence of something; a <em>principle</em>. A theory or belief; a <em>principle</em>. No morals; no <em>principles</em>.</p>

<p>All those different words used in the translations for <em>dhamma</em>, can be substitute with one word: principle. It clarifies and makes it directly recognizable.</p>

<h4>Pāḷi-English</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Dhamma</strong> (m. nt.) principle.</p>
