<p><em>Ariyasāvaka</em> is often found translated as noble disciple.</p>

<p>It is a compound formed with the words <em>ariya</em> and <em>sāvaka</em>. <em>Ariya</em> is said to refer to the generally approved and esteemed customs and ideals of the Aryan clans, covering the racial, social and ethical aspects translated as noble and <em>sāvaka</em> as disciple.</p>

<p>Noble disciple seems to indicate the disciple as the noble one, but note that in this context for an <em>arahant</em> '<em>sāvaka</em>' is used, not <em>ariyasāvaka</em>, which makes this a little odd. It ironically also seem to make some people wonder who exactly is when noble.</p>

<p>Another rendering is disciple of the noble one(s). At least here people can be disciples without worrying about their status as nobility, but again for the <em>arahant</em> is in this context <em>sāvakā</em> used. Thus if for the <em>arahant</em> noble falls off then it is a bit odd to then suddenly refer to them here as noble ones.</p>

<p>Both translations leave some oddness by trying to assign noble to a certain person. But noble here stood for the social and ethical direction. So it was about the learning/following the good, the highest, righteousness, of all of those traits for which aryan stood example. And for this generalization we then can get to use nobleness. A monastic is here not a noble one, a virtuous one is here not a noble one, the exalted one is here not a noble one, and the <em>dhamma</em> is here not noble (after all there are unwholesome <em>dhammā</em>) but nobleness is and noble principles are.</p>

<p>So then, disciple of nobleness? But what exactly would that mean? The word disciple implies a certain relationship with nobleness and since nobleness is an abstract word it leaves this ambiguous. Then let's look at <em>sāvaka</em> as well.</p>

<p>The dictionary says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Sāvaka</strong> [fr. śru] a hearer, disciple.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And with hearer we would not have the problem as with disciple. Hearers also have a long standing relation with oral traditions, so that fits.</p>

<p>Then for <em>ariyasāvaka</em> we can have 'hearer of nobleness', as in hearer of the good. Even when the exalted ones' words are long gone, one can set certain things as nobler, higher, not to admire but to advance to; thus as to undertake, as practise. Advancing this way keeps siding with the good. And when the <em>dhamma</em> is discovered then it is set as the new highest. So as principle this seems to fit as well.</p>

<p>So for the compound <em>ariyasāvaka</em> we now have removed an assumed person from being assigned to as noble, and we have removed an assumed person from being assigned to as having disciples. This doesn't mean you can't regard someone as noble or regard someone as having disciples, it is just that it doesn't have to be that this is here what it is about. Now noble is inclined for nobleness; again it is not a person who is noble but rather the nobleness of what is noble. And of what is noble that a hearer gets to be educated about. The <em>ariyasāvaka</em> and <em>arahant</em> are both <em>sāvakā</em> (hearers, hearers of the exalted one's word). Since the <em>arahant</em> is done with going, siding, that <em>direction towards</em> the good, that undertaking, the education, does not apply. This way it can be understood why an <em>arahant</em> is then not referred to as <em>ariyasāvaka</em>.</p>

<p>With the problems gone and to make sense both and grammatically and in meaning, we can use either 'hearer of nobleness' or 'hearer of what is noble'. Both say the same but perhaps the least abstract version makes it more clear. Then a line could go something like this: <em>'OK here, almsmen, having learned, the hearer of what is noble pays attention ...'</em></p>

<h4>Pāḷi-English</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Ariya</strong> (adj. — n.) noble. <br>
<strong>— sāvaka</strong> hearer of what is noble.</p>
