<p>OK then a certain almsman approached there where the exalted one was. Having approached the exalted one he exchanged greetings with him. Having finished the politely exchanged greetings he sat down at one end. OK at one end seated he, the almsman, said this to the exalted one:</p>

<p>'<em>The world, the world</em>, venerable, it is said.
OK, now to what extend, venerable, is it called 'world'?' </p>

<p>'OK, it is open to "we're old", almsman, from that it is called 'world'.</p>

<p>And what is open to "we're old"?</p>

<p>OK, eye, almsmen, is open to "we're old".
Forms are open to "we're old". Eye-cognition is open to "we're old".
With-eye-touch is open to "we're old".
Also this what with support of with-eye-touch arises, the felt or happiness or suffering or neither happiness nor suffering, that also is open to "we're old".</p>

<p><em>Ear ... Nose ... Tongue ... Body ... Intellect ...</em></p>

<p>OK, open to "we're old", almsman, from that it is called 'world'.'</p>
