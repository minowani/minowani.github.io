<p>'These nine, almsmen, are successive cessations. 
Which nine?</p>

<ol>
<li>First radiance, when engaged in, lust perception has ceased.</li>
<li>Second radiance, when engaged in, thoughts and thinking have ceased.</li>
<li>Third radiance, when engaged in, pleasantness has ceased.</li>
<li>Forth radiance, when engaged in, breathing in and breathing out have ceased.</li>
<li>Boundless sky as base, when engaged in, perception of form has ceased.</li>
<li>Boundless cognition as base, when engaged in, perception of boundless sky as base has ceased.</li>
<li>Possessionlessness as base, when engaged in, perception of boundless cognition as base has ceased.</li>
<li>Neither-perception-nor-no-perception as base, when engaged in, perception of possessionlessness as base has ceased.</li>
<li>Cessation of perception of the felt, when engaged in, and perception and feeling have ceased.</li>
</ol>

<p>OK these, almsmen, are nine successive cessations.'</p>
