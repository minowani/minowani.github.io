<p>In the Pāḷi texts different words are used which in English are often translated as mind. Those words are sometimes said to be synonyms. However, their specific usage seems rather consequently applied and I would like to see if we could keep those distinctions.</p>

<p>It is a bit like when a countryman asks you where you are from, and you might answer with a towns name. But when you are in another country and a local asks you where you are from, you might answer with a country name or, if you are from a well known city, the name of the city. It does depend on the context, and it does mean sometimes all can be used, but it doesn’t mean they are synonyms. To me it is similar with mind.</p>

<p>Mind is used for <em>citta</em>, <em>ceto</em>, <em>mano</em> and <em>viññana</em>:</p>

<p><strong>Citta</strong></p>

<p>When we talk about the body and mind, as duo, they are referred to in Pāḷi as <em>kāya</em> and <em>citta</em>; so let's then reserve mind for <em>citta</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Ceto</strong></p>

<p><em>Ceto</em> is connected to the feeling side for which I use mentality, 'the heart'. With then <em>cetasika</em> (belonging to <em>ceto</em>) as mental, like f.i. a mental feeling:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Saññā ca vedanā ca cetasikā, ete dhammā cittappaṭibaddhā</em>.  </p>

<p>'And perception and feeling are mental, these principles are bound to mind.' MN44</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Mano</strong></p>

<p><em>Mano</em> seems to be associated with doing, the acting side (e.g. <em>manokamma</em>), as in 'thinking-mind', 'doing-mind', for which I use intellect, 'the head'.  </p>

<p><strong>Viññana</strong></p>

<p>And for <em>viññana</em> I use cognition, from the Latin <em>cognoscere</em> meaning 'to know': </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Vijānātīti kho, bhikkhave, tasmā ‘viññāṇan’ti vuccati</em>.  </p>

<p>'OK it cognizes, almsmen, from that it is called cognition.' SN22.79</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>One for All</strong></p>

<p>It is a bit difficult to map these Pāḷi words with English where these distinctions may not that strictly be used. Intellect might feel a bit off when taken on as (being) intellectual, likewise mentality and (being) mental, while for some mentality might be more related to thinking than feeling. Anyhow here I use them just as distinctions of mind, Mind, Mind-that-undergoes, Mind-that-does and Mind-that-discerns. And so, mind (<em>citta</em>) can be used for cognition (<em>viññana</em>) when it comes to cognizing, or for intellect (<em>mano</em>) when the emphasis lies on intention, but neither <em>ceto</em> nor <em>mano</em> contains <em>viññana</em>; they are not that freely exchangeable. So to me it is like this:</p>

<p>Mind (<em>citta</em>) = mentality (<em>ceto</em>) + intellect (<em>mano</em>) + cognition (<em>viññana</em>).</p>

<h4>Pāḷi-English</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Ceto</strong> (nt.) mentality. <br>
<strong>Citta</strong> (nt.) mind. <br>
<strong>Mano</strong> (nt.) intellect. <br>
<strong>Viññana</strong> (nt.) cognition.</p>
