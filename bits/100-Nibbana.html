<p><em>Nibbāna</em> is often left untranslated and/or is unclear.</p>

<p>Translations for <em>nibbāna</em> can sometimes be found in glossaries yet they may not be used in the texts. And extinction, extinguishing, unbinding don't make it clear enough. When translating <em>nibbāna</em> there are a few points to take into account:</p>

<ol>
<li>It is a word which would be ordinarily used by ordinarily people. People do have a perception of what <em>nibbāna</em> is even when they don't directly know it for themselves.</li>
<li>It is seen as positive.</li>
<li>It has to do with stilling, stopping, specifically regarding greed, hate and delusion.</li>
<li>It is the highest goal; it comes after freedom, emancipation!</li>
</ol>

<p>I use peace for <em>nibbāna</em>. Let's check it against the points above:</p>

<ol>
<li>People know what peace is, even though they might not have experienced it directly or fully by themselves.</li>
<li>Peace is seen as positive.</li>
<li>It can be understood that with greed, hate and delusion there is no real peace.</li>
<li>Freedom, but for what purpose? For doing what you like? Then you are not really free; a slave of desires. But for the ultimate peace? That surely is the highest!</li>
</ol>

<p>Many questions about <em>nibbāna</em> are not that careful, because <em>nibbāna</em> has become an abstract. If instead of '<em>Is nibbāna not boring?</em>', '<em>Is peace not boring?</em>' was asked, it is easier to see that then peace would be lacking. So this translation clarifies and takes the points above into account as well.</p>

<h4>Pāḷi-English</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Nibbāna</strong> (nt.) peace.</p>
