<p>'Not having learned, almsmen, the commoner gets to feel a feeling also happily, 
gets to feel a feeling also sufferingly,
gets to feel a feeling also neither happily nor sufferingly.
In this, almsmen, what is the distinction, what is the peculiarity, what is making the difference for the learned hearer of what is noble with the not learned commoner?'</p>

<p>'Our principles are, venerable, rooted in the exalted one...'</p>

<p>'Not having learned, almsmen, the commoner being touched by a feeling to suffer grieves, is in misery, wails, beats the chest, laments, gets into bewilderment.
He gets to feel two feelings: and a bodily and a mental.
Also as that, almsmen, a man would be pierced with a spike
that with this, along the piercing, he would be pierced by a second spike.
Because so, almsmen, that man gets to feel the feeling by two spikes.
OK just so, almsmen, not having learned the commoner being touched by a feeling to suffer grieves, is in misery, wails, beats the chest, laments, undergoes bewilderment.
He gets to feel two feelings: and a bodily and a mental. 
OK just from that, yet while being touched by a feeling to suffer, friction is.
That with this, with a feeling to suffer, the frictional; what to a feeling to suffer the dormancy of friction is, that is dormant.
He, being touched by a feeling to suffer, welcomes the happiness by lust.</p>

<p>Of what is that the reason?</p>

<p>For he, almsmen, doesn't know. The commoner has not learned the departure of a feeling to suffer seperate from the happiness by lust.
For that he has been pleased with happiness by lust and what by a feeling to be happy the dormancy of passion is, that is dormant.
He essentially not knows and the rise, and the settling down, and the sweetness, and the wretchedness, and the departure of those feelings.
For he essentially not understood and the rise, and the settling down, and the sweetness, and the wretchedness, and the departure of those feelings, what to a feeling neither happily nor sufferingly the dormancy of not knowing is that is dormant.
That if he gets to feel a feeling happily, he gets to feel this linked. If he gets to feel a feeling sufferingly, he gets to feel this linked. If he gets to feel a feeling neither happily nor sufferingly, he gets to feel this linked.
This is called, almsmen, 'the commoner who has not learned: linked with birth, with ageing, with death, with sorrows, with lamentations, with sufferings, with distresses, with unrests; linked to suffering' I say.</p>

<p>OK and having learned, almsmen, the hearer of what is noble being touched by feeling to suffer grieves not, is not in misery, wails not, not beats the chest, laments not, not undergoes bewilderment;
he gets to feel one feeling: bodily, not mental.
Also as that, almsmen, a man would be pierced with a spike.
That with this, after the piercing, he would not be pierced by a second spike.
Because so, almsmen, that man gets to feel the feeling by one spike.
OK just so, almsmen, having learned the hearer of what is noble being touched by a feeling to suffer grieves not, is not in misery, wails not, not beats the chest, laments not, not undergoes bewilderment;
he gets to feel one feeling: bodily, not mental.
OK just from that, yet while being touched by a feeling to suffer, friction is not.
That with this, with a feeling to suffer, the frictionless; what to a feeling to suffer the dormancy of friction is, that is not dormant. 
He, being touched by a feeling to suffer, does not welcome the happiness by lust.</p>

<p>Of what is that the reason?</p>

<p>For he, almsmen, does know. The hearer of what is noble has learned the departure of a feeling to suffer seperate from happiness by lust.
For that he has not been welcoming the happiness by lust; what by a feeling to be happy the dormancy of passion is, that is not dormant.
He essentially knows: and the rise, and the settling down, and the sweetness, and the wretchedness, and the departure of those feelings.
For he essentially understood and the rise, and the settling down, and the sweetness, and the wretchedness, and the departure of those feelings, what to a feeling neither happily nor sufferingly the dormancy of not knowing is, that is not dormant.
That if he gets to feel a feeling happily, he gets to feel this unlinked. If he gets to feel a feeling sufferingly, he gets to feel this unlinked. If he gets to feel a feeling neither happily nor sufferingly, he gets to feel this unlinked.
This is called, almsmen, 'the hearer of what is noble who has learned: unlinked with birth, with ageing, with death, with sorrows, with lamentations, with sufferings, with distresses, with unrests; unlinked to suffering' I say.</p>

<p>OK this, almsmen, is the distinction, this is the peculiarity, this is making the difference for the learned hearer of what is noble with the not learned commoner.'</p>

<p>The wise gets to feel no feeling, <br>
also happily also sufferingly, also he learned a lot. <br>
And this, of the steadfast with the commoner, <br>
is the great distinction of wholesomeness.   </p>

<p>For having learned a lot, having recognized the principle, <br>
insighted is this world and further. <br>
With wanted principles the mind does not shake, <br>
with the unwanted no friction comes.</p>

<p>For those compliances and/or non-compliances <br>
are scattered, they are gone; not 'they are'. <br>
And the step, familiarizing the stainless, sorrowless, <br>
he rightly knows; having gone across of existence. </p>
