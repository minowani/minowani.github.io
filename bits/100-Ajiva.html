<p><em>Ājīva</em> is often translated as livelihood.</p>

<p>And it certainly has to do with livelihood; in the texts particulars of <em>ājīva</em> very often includes jobs. But also found are things like: ‘With right doing, right <em>ājīva</em>; with wrong doing, wrong <em>ājīva</em>’. Thus a foolish person has, in spite of their livelihood, the wrong <em>ājīva</em>. </p>

<p>So to put less emphasis on just income, we can look for an alternative. <em>Jīva</em> means life and the <em>ā</em> as prefix can indicate a transitive function, we then got living. But, especially since we are used to livelihood, living doesn't make it that much more clearer. We can also look at it as with <em>ācāra</em>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Ācāra</strong> [ā + <strong>car</strong>] way of conduct</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We then got with [ā+jīva] way of life. That a foolish person would have in spite of their livelihood a wrong way of life would make sense. And it does connect:</p>

<p><em>With right view, right attitude; with right attitude, right speech; with right speech, right doing; with right doing, right way of life.</em></p>

<h4>Pāḷi-English</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Ājīva</strong> [ā+jīva] way of life.</p>
</blockquote>
