<p><em>Saṅkappa</em> is often translated as thought.</p>

<p>We got thoughts all over the path... it seems so vague.</p>

<p>What we can read is that there are three right ones <em>nekkhammasaṅkappo, abyāpādasaṅkappo, avihiṃsāsaṅkappo</em> and three wrong ones <em>kāmasaṅkappo, byāpādasaṅkappo, vihiṃsāsaṅkappo</em>.</p>

<p><em>Nekkhamma</em> has to do with putting away lust (<em>kāma</em>) thus abstinence, <em>abyāpāda</em> is 'without anger' and <em>avihiṃsā</em> is 'without harm'. The three wrong ones are the ones 'with lust', 'with anger' and 'with harm'. They correspond with greed, hatred and delusion. The links with greed and hate might be clear, and for the last one it shouldn't be hard to see that if someone doesn't know what he or she is doing, is deluded about that, it will cause harm; thus harmful.</p>

<p>While we can have thoughts with abstinence (<em>nekkhammavitakko</em>), thoughts without anger (<em>abyāpādavitakko</em>) and thoughts without harm (<em>avihiṃsāvitakko</em>), it is a bit different from how to actually approach things, carry yourself, position yourself as with abstinence, without anger, without harm. And this is to me what <em>saṅkappa</em> is, attitude. Which does connect:</p>

<p><em>With right view, right attitude.</em></p>

<h4>Pāḷi-English</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Saṅkappa</strong> attitude.</p>
