<p>On one occasion the exalted one dwells at the deer park at Isipatana, at Bārāṇasi.
OK, there the exalted one addressed the almsmen of the group of five:</p>

<p>'Almsmen'</p>

<p>Those almsmen replied to the exalted one:</p>

<p>'Venerable sir'</p>

<p>The exalted one said this:</p>

<p>'Form, almsmen, is not self.
And form, almsmen, for this self if it becomes, this not would lead form to oppression and you would get at form:
'My form be so, as my form was not so'.
OK and because, almsmen, form is not self, from that form leads to oppression and you not get at form: 
'My form be so, as my form was not so'.'</p>

<p><em>Feeling ... Perception ... Inclinations ... Cognition ...</em> </p>

<p>'What is it that you deem, almsmen, is form or stable or unstable?'</p>

<p>'Unstable, venerable'</p>

<p>'What is yet unstable, is that sufferingly or happily?'</p>

<p>'Sufferingly, venerable'</p>

<p>'What is yet unstable, sufferingly, the principle for change, is that now sound to see as:
'This is of me, this is the I exist, this is to me self'?'</p>

<p>'Of course not, venerable.'</p>

<p><em>... feeling ... perception ... inclinations ... cognition ...</em></p>

<p>'Therefore, almsmen, 'whatever form, past, not yet come, current, or inner or outer, or gross or subtle, or low or high, what is in the distant or in the vicinity, all form
is essentially with right wisdom similarly to be viewed as
'Not this is of me, not this is the I exist, not this is to me self'.'</p>

<p><em>... feeling ... perception ... inclinations ... cognition...</em></p>

<p>'Seeing so, almsmen, having learned, the hearer of what is noble gets fed up also on form, gets fed up also on feeling, gets fed up also on perception, gets fed up also on inclinations, gets fed up also on cognition.
Fed up, he lacks interest; from the fading he is to be emancipated.
Upon emancipation, thus emancipated, the knowledge is.
He fathoms 'Birth is barren, the clergy conduct spent, done is what ought to be done, no more earning of presence'.'</p>

<p>This said the exalted one.</p>

<p>Pleased, the almsmen of the group of five welcomed the exalted one's talk.
And while this explanation was yet being recited, the almsmen of the group of five were without taking it up as drains; the minds thus emancipated. </p>
