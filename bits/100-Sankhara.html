<p><em>Saṅkhārā</em> is often seen translated as (volitional) formations, fabrications, etc.</p>

<p>It is certainly understandable how certain aspects of <em>saṅkhārā</em> got to be translated as <em>saṅkhārā</em>, but in doing so it also got a bit abstract and unclear.</p>

<p>Important is to remember that all what is taken up as 'me, this I am, this is myself' which do not fall into one of the other masses-and-the-taking-up, fall into this one. And what do you think, do you sense you to be (volitional) formations or fabrications?</p>

<p><em>Saṅkhārā</em> translates as inclinations. When we say one is wired in such way or one is of such or so character it relates to this mass, and when something goes against how you are wired, thus inclined, <em>then</em> you‘ll quickly notice how strongly this goes against your sense of being; <em>you</em>. </p>

<p>(For a more in-depth explanation on inclinations in the context of dependent-co-arising see Knowing.)</p>

<h4>Pāḷi-English</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Saṅkhārā</strong> (pl.) inclinations.</p>
