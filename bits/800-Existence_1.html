<p>OK, then senior Ānanda went by there where the exalted one was.
Having gone up to the exalted one, having saluted, he sat down at one side.
OK, at one side seated senior Ānanda said this to the exalted one:  </p>

<p>''Existence, existence', venerable, it is said.
OK now in what respect, venerable, existence is?'  </p>

<p>'And the aspect of lust and ripening, Ānanda, if not existed the action, OK now on to existence with lust, could it be distinguished?'</p>

<p>'Of course not, venerable.'  </p>

<p>'OK thus, Ānanda, is action the field, cognition the seed, longing the moisture.</p>

<p>Not knowing the obstructions, for beings with yokes of longing for the lower aspects, cognition found support. So is the stretching forth, the production towards a following existence.</p>

<p>And the aspect of form and ripening, Ānanda, if not existed the action, OK now on to existence with form, could it be distinguished?'  </p>

<p>'Of course not, venerable.'  </p>

<p>'OK thus, Ānanda, is action the field, cognition the seed, longing the moisture.
Not knowing the obstructions, for beings with yokes of longing for the medium aspects, cognition found support. So is the stretching forth, the production towards a following existence.</p>

<p>And the aspect of formlessness and ripening, Ānanda, if not existed the action, OK now on to existence without form, could it be distinguished?'  </p>

<p>'Of course not, venerable.'  </p>

<p>'OK thus, Ānanda, is action the field, cognition the seed, longing the moisture.
Not knowing the obstructions, for beings with yokes of longing for the higher aspects, cognition found support. So is the stretching forth, the production towards a following existence.</p>

<p>OK so, Ānanda, existence is.'  </p>
