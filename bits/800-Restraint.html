<li>exertion of rejection.</li>
<li>exertion of cultivation.</li>
<li>exertion of preservation.</li>
</ul>

<p>And which, almsmen, exertion of restraint?</p>

<p>Here, almsmen, an almsman, viewing form by eye, is not a holder of indications, not a holder of details,
by reason of which there to, the strength of the eye abiding unrestrained, he would befall to avarice and distress, evil, unwholesome principles.
To restrain that he goes against, he guards against, the strength of the eye. The strength of the eye undergoes the restraint.
Hearing a sound by ear ... Smelling a scent by nose ... Tasting a taste by tongue ... Touching a tangible by body ... Knowing a principle by intellect, is not a holder of indications, not a holder of details,
by reason of which there to, the strength of the intellect abiding unrestrained, he would befall to avarice and distress, evil, unwholesome principles.
To restrain that he goes against, he guards against, the strength of the intellect. The strength of the intellect undergoes the restraint.
This is called, almsmen, exertion of restraint.</p>

<p>And which, almsmen, exertion of rejection?</p>

<p>Here, almsmen, an almsman not endures, gives up, dispels, destroys, annihilates arisen lustful thoughts 
... arisen angry thoughts ... arisen harmful thoughts ... whichever arisen evil, unwholesome principles. 
This is called, almsmen, exertion of rejection.</p>

<p>And which, almsmen, exertion of cultivation?</p>

<p>Here, almsmen, an almsman cultivates recollection as member of enlightenment ... 
pondering on principles as member of enlightenment ... vigour as member of enlightenment ... pleasantness as member of enlightenment ... calmness as member of enlightenment ... concentration as member of enlightenment ... objectivity as member of enlightenment, bent on withdrawal, bent on fading, bent on cessation, resulting in relinquishment. 
This is called, almsmen, exertion of cultivation.</p>

<p>And which, almsmen, exertion of preservation? </p>

<p>Here, almsmen, an almsman preserves an arisen suitable indication of concentration: the perception of a skeleton, the perception of a maggot infested cadaver, the perception of a discoloured cadaver, the perception of a festering cadaver, the perception of a fissured cadaver, the perception of a bloated cadaver. 
This is called, almsmen, exertion of preservation.</p>

<p>OK these, almsmen, are the four exertions.' </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>'And restraint and rejection, cultivation, preservation</em> <br>
<em>these four exertions are pointed out by the Kinsman of the Sun</em> <br>
<em>by which the here ardent almsman</em> <br>
<em>ought to reach the barrenness of suffering'</em> </p>
