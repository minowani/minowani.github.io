<p>'These four, almsmen, noble truths.</p>

<p>Which four? </p>

<ul>
<li>Suffering as a noble truth.</li>
<li>Rise of suffering as a noble truth.</li>
<li>Cessation of suffering as a noble truth.</li>
<li>The path heading for the cessation of suffering as a noble truth. </li>
</ul>

<p>And which, almsmen, suffering as a noble truth?  </p>

<p>'The five masses-and-the-taking-up' is to this to be answered, viz. the mass-of-form-and-the-taking-up, the mass-of-feeling-and-the-taking-up, the mass-of-perception-and-the-taking-up, the mass-of-inclinations-and-the-taking-up, the mass-of-cognition-and-the-taking-up. This is called, almsmen, suffering as a noble truth.  </p>

<p>And which, almsmen, rise of suffering as a noble truth?  </p>

<p>This what is the longing, the gone together of joy and passion, the welcoming of this and that, pertains to a following existence;
viz. the longing for lust, the longing for existence, the longing for non-existence. </p>

<p>And which, almsmen, cessation of suffering as a noble truth? </p>

<p>What just from that longing, is the complete fading and cessation, the abandoning, the renunciation, the release, the non-clinging.
This is called, almsmen, cessation of suffering as a noble truth. </p>

<p>And which, almsmen, the path heading for the cessation of suffering as a noble truth?  </p>

<p>Just this noble eightfold way, viz. right view, right attitude, right speech, right doing, right way of life, right effort, right recollection, right concentration. This is called, almsmen, the path heading for the cessation of suffering as a noble truth. </p>

<p>OK these, almsmen, are four noble truths. 
Therefore, almsmen, '<em>This</em>, is suffering' is the effort to be made. '<em>This</em>, is rise of suffering' is the effort to be made. '<em>This</em>, is cessation of suffering' is the effort to be made. '<em>This</em>, is the path heading for the cessation of suffering' is the effort to be made.'</p>
