<p>So I learned:</p>

<p>On one occasion the exalted one dwells at the eastern park Migāramātupāsāda, at Sāvatthi.
OK, there the exalted one addressed the almsmen:</p>

<p>'OK now, almsmen, from the cultivation, making a lot of, of how many strengths, the drains barren, an almsman answers another:
'I fathom birth is barren, the clergy conduct spent, done is what ought to be done, no more earning of presence'?'</p>

<p>'Our principles are, venerable, rooted in the exalted one, guided by the exalted, have the exalted one as resort. 
As good custom, venerable, may the exalted one just so illuminate the settlement of this talk.
Having learned from the exalted one the almsmen will endorse it.'</p>

<p>'OK, almsmen, from the cultivation, from making a lot of, of one strength, the drains barren, an almsman answers another:
'I fathom birth is barren, the clergy conduct spent, done is what ought to be done, no more earning of presence.'
Of which one? 
Of the strength of wisdom; from wisdom, almsmen, for the hearer of what is noble confirmation then accordingly coincides,
vigour then accordingly coincides, meditation then accordingly coincides, concentration then accordingly coincides.
OK for this, almsmen, from the cultivation, making a lot of, of one strength, the drains barren, an almsman answers another:
'I fathom birth is barren, the clergy conduct spent, done is what ought to be done, no more earning of presence'.'</p>
