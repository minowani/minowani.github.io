<p>In AN8.29 <em>Akkhaṇasuttaṃ</em> we find people thinking the world had a chance, an opportunity, to benefit from the awakened one, because he was then there in the world.</p>

<p>But we find the awakened one stating people mistake his being in the world for an opportunity. Even with him there those in hell can't benefit, nor the animals, nor the ghosts, nor some certain gods, nor those living in regions where the awakened one's followers do not travel, nor those living close enough but with to strong wrong views, nor those simply to dumb to understand. For those it is a miss.</p>

<p>There is also the case when a person is capable but the principle has not been made clear, then too it will be a miss. Thus with the principle made clear don't miss out on the opportunity; study the texts so once in a while.</p>
