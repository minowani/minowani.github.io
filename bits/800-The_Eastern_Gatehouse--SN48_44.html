<p>So I learned:</p>

<p>On one occasion the exalted one dwells at the eastern gatehouse, at Sāvatthi.
OK, there the exalted one addressed senior Sāriputta:</p>

<p>'Do you believe, Sāriputta,
the strength of confidence, cultivated, made a lot of, is immersed in immortality. Immortality is the relief; immortality fulfils the stopping.
<em>The strength of vigour ... meditation ... concentration ... wisdom ...</em></p>

<p>'OK I don't go here, venerable, to the exalted one for confidence: 
the strength of confidence cultivated, made a lot of, is immersed in immortality, immortality is the relief, immortality fulfils the stopping. <em>The strength of vigour ... meditation ... concentration ... wisdom ...</em>
Of course for whom, venerable, it has not been familiarized, not viewed, not found out, not realised, not touched by wisdom, there one would go to others for this confidence: 
the strength of confidence cultivated, made a lot of, is immersed in immortality, immortality is the relief, immortality fulfils the stopping. <em>The strength of vigour ... meditation ... concentration ... wisdom ...</em>
OK and for those that, venerable, familiarized, viewed, found out, realised, touched by wisdom, there one without doubt has the reliance:
the strength of confidence cultivated, made a lot of, is immersed in immortality, immortality is the relief, immortality fulfils the stopping. <em>The strength of vigour ... meditation ... concentration ... wisdom ...</em>
OK and for me this, venerable, has been familiarized, found out, realised, touched by wisdom, 
there I without doubt have the reliance: the strength of confidence cultivated, made a lot of, is immersed in immortality, immortality is the relief, immortality fulfils the stopping. <em>The strength of vigour ... meditation ... concentration ... wisdom ...</em>'</p>

<p>'Good, good, Sāriputta, so for whoever, Sāriputta, it has not been familiarized, not viewed, not found out, not realised, not touched by wisdom, there those would go to others for this confidence:
the strength of confidence cultivated, made a lot of, is immersed in immortality, immortality is the relief, immortality fulfils the stopping. <em>The strenght of vigour ... meditation ... concentration ... wisdom ...</em>
OK and of those that, Sāriputta, familiarized, found out, realised, touched by by wisdom, there they without doubt have the reliance:
the strength of confidence cultivated, made a lot of, is immersed in immortality; immortality is the relief, immortality fulfils the stopping. The strength of vigour cultivated, made a lot of, is immersed in immortality; immortality is the relief, immortality fulfils the stopping. The strength of meditation cultivated, made a lot of, is immersed in immortality; immortality is the relief, immortality fulfils the stopping. The strength of concentration cultivated, made a lot of, is immersed in immortality; immortality is the relief, immortality fulfils the stopping. The strength of wisdom cultivated, made a lot of, is immersed in immortality; immortality is the relief, immortality fulfils the stopping.' </p>
