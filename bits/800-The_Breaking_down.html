<p>'I shall point out to you, almsmen, and the continuation of recollection, and the cultivation of the continuation of recollection, and for the cultivation of the continuation of recollection the path.
Hear that.</p>

<p>And which, almsmen, the continuation of recollection?</p>

<p>Here, almsmen, and almsman looking at the body, dwells in the body; as the ardent aware recollector would remove the avarice and distress about the world.
Looking at feelings, dwells in feelings ... looking at mind, dwells in mind ... looking at principles, dwells in principles; as the ardent aware recollector would remove the avarice and distress about the world.
This is called, almsmen, the continuation of recollection.</p>

<p>And which, almsmen, the cultivation of the continuation of recollection?</p>

<p>Here, almsmen, an almsman looking at the rise of principles, dwells in the body, looking at the passing of principles, dwells in the body, looking at the rise and passing of principles, dwells in the body; as the ardent aware recollector would remove the avarice and distress about the world.
... feelings ... mind ... principles ...
This is called, almsmen, the cultivation of the continuation of principles.</p>

<p>And which, almsmen, the path for the cultivation of the continuation of recollection?</p>

<p>Just this noble eightfold way, viz. right view, right attitude, right speech, right doing, right way of life, right effort, right recollection, right concentration. 
This is called, almsmen, the path heading for the cultivation of the continuation of recollection.'</p>
