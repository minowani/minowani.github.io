<p>At Sāvatthi.</p>

<p>OK then Timbaruka the wanderer approached there where the exalted one was.
Having approached the exalted one he exchanged greetings with him.
Having finished the politely exchanged greetings he sat down at one end.
OK, at one end seated the wanderer Timbaruka said this to the exalted one: </p>

<p>'OK now what, dear Gotama, are happiness and suffering made by one's own?'</p>

<p>'Not for so, Timbaruka' said the exalted one. </p>

<p>'Yet what, dear Gotama, are happiness and suffering made by others?'</p>

<p>'Not for so, Timbaruka' said the exalted one.</p>

<p>'OK now what, dear Gotama, are happiness and suffering, and made by one's own and made by others?'</p>

<p>'Not for so, Timbaruka' said the exalted one.</p>

<p>'Yet what, dear Gotama, are happiness and suffering, a fortuitous engagement, not made by one's own, not made by others?'</p>

<p>'Not for so, Timbaruka' said the exalted one.</p>

<p>'OK now what, dear Gotama, do happiness and suffering not exist?'</p>

<p>'OK not, Timbaruka, do happiness and suffering not exist, OK Timbaruka, happiness and suffering do exist.'</p>

<p>'By that, for the exalted Gotama is not familiar with, does not see, happiness and suffering?'</p>

<p>'OK I not, Timbaruka, am not familiar, do not see, happiness and suffering.
OK I am familiar, Timbaruka, with happiness and suffering;
OK I do see, Timbaruka, happiness and suffering.'</p>

<p>'OK now what, dear Gotama, 'happiness and suffering are made by one's own',
thus similar asked, 'Not for so, Timbaruka' you say
'Yet what, dear Gotama, happiness and suffering are made by others',
thus similar asked, 'Not for so, Timbaruka' you say
'OK now what, dear Gotama, happiness and suffering are made by others',
thus similar asked, 'Not for so, Timbaruka' you say
'Yet what, dear Gotama, is happiness and suffering a fortuitous engagement, not made by one's own, not made by others?',
thus similar asked, 'Not for so, Timbaruka' you say
'OK what now, dear Gotama, do happiness and suffering not exit?',
thus similar asked, 'OK not, Timbaruka, do happiness and suffering not exist;
OK it exist, Timbaruka, happiness and suffering' you say
'By that, for the exalted Gotama is not familiar with, does not see, happiness and suffering?',
thus similar asked, 'OK I not, Timbaruka, am not familiar, do not see, happiness and suffering.
OK I am familiar with, Timbaruka, happiness and suffering'
OK I do see, Timbaruka, happiness and suffering' you say.
You Gotama, may you disclose to me and happiness and suffering,
you Gotama, may you point out to me and happiness and suffering.'</p>

<p>'That feeling one feels', OK Timbaruka, existing as if from the beginning:
'made by one's own is the happiness and suffering', such I did also not say.
'Another feeling, one another feels', OK Timbaruka, existing as if struck by feeling:
'made by others is the happiness and suffering', such I did also not say.</p>

<p>These are for you, Timbaruka, the both ends having to go by; the Tathāgata points out the principle by the middle:</p>

<p>With support of not knowing, inclinations. With support of inclinations, cognition. With support of cognition, name-and-form. With support of name-and-form, hexad-base. With support of hexad-base, touch. With support of touch, feeling. With support of feeling, longing. With support of longing, taking up. With support of taking up, becoming. With support of becoming, birth. With support of birth, ageing-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, suffering, distress, unrest appear.
So for this entire mass of suffering the rise is.</p>

<p>However, with complete fading and cessation of not knowing, cessation of inclinations. With cessation of inclinations, cessation of cognition. With cessation of cognition, cessation of name-and-form. With cessation of name-and-form, cessation of hexad-base. With cessation of hexad-base, cessation of touch. With cessation of touch, cessation of feeling. With cessation of feeling, cessation of longing. With cessation of longing, cessation of taking up. With cessation of taking up, cessation of becoming. With cessation of becoming, cessation of birth. With cessation of birth, ageing-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, suffering, distress, unrest cease.
So for this entire mass of suffering the cessation is.’</p>

<p>So said, Timbaruko the wanderer said this to the exalted one:
'Excellent, dear Gotama .... This I goes to Gotama the exalted one, and the principle, and the assembly of almsmen, as refuge.
I the follower, have you Gotama for endorser, from this day on while endowed with breath, as the refuge gone to.’</p>
