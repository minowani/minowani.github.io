<h3 class="nav">Three Types of Dukkha</h3>
<p>In the texts (e.g. SN38.14, SN45.165, DN33) the three types of suffering are just named, not explained. They are explained outside the texts but so far I have seen them those led to weird implications. So here an alternative.</p>

<p><strong>1. Dukkhadukkhatā</strong></p>

<p><em>Dukkha</em> due to suffering (<em>dukkha</em>). And what is suffering? Birth, ageing-and-death. This doesn’t mean one must feel sorrow or have an unhappy life. One can be very happy and joyful in this life. The point is that when there is no security from them, sooner or later, grievous things will happen for sure.</p>

<p>Thus for the virtuous one there is no <em>dukkhadukkhatā</em> since birth, ageing and dying has stopped; the deathless has been reached.</p>

<p><strong>2. Saṅkhāradukkhatā</strong></p>

<p><em>Dukkha</em> due to inclination (<em>saṅkhāra</em>). Sometimes people keep making bad decisions and suffer the consequences. It might seem as if they just can’t help themselves, as if they are wired that way (inclined). They are more inclined to act out of greed, hatred and delusion.</p>

<p>Thus for the virtuous one there is no <em>saṅkhāradukkhatā</em> since unwholesome choices can’t be made as greed, hatred and delusion are uprooted; there is thus no such inclination.</p>

<p><strong>3. Vipariṇāmadukkhatā</strong></p>

<p><em>Dukkha</em> due to change (<em>vipariṇāma</em>). As suffering is due to it, it is a change for the worse. We might get robbed, our environment may have to deal with severe weather conditions, we might get sick, our countries might get into war, etc. So suffering due to all these sort of changes, as when run out of luck (so to speak) or in case of force majeure.</p>

<p>Thus for the virtuous one there is no <em>vipariṇāmadukkhatā</em> since there is no appropriation, no regarding things as me, mine, for me, to me; there is no suffering depending on this.</p>
