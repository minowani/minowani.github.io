<p>Situated at Sāvatthi.</p>

<p>OK, then a certain clergyman approached there where the exalted one was.
Having approached the exalted one he exchanged greetings with him.
Having finished the politely exchanged greetings he sat down at one end.
OK, at one end seated he, the clergyman, said this to the exalted one:</p>

<p>'OK now what is it, dear Gotama, is he who does, he who gets to experience?'</p>

<p>''Is he who does, he who gets to experience', OK clergyman, this is one end.'</p>

<p>'Yet what is it, dear Gotama, another does, another gets to experience?'</p>

<p>''Another does, another gets to experience', OK clergyman, this is the second end.</p>

<p>These are for you, clergyman, the both ends having to go by; the Tathāgata points out the principle by the middle:</p>

<p>With support of not knowing, inclinations. With support of inclinations, cognition. With support of cognition, name-and-form. With support of name-and-form, hexad-base. With support of hexad-base, touch. With support of touch, feeling. With support of feeling, longing. With support of longing, taking up. With support of taking up, becoming. With support of becoming, birth. With support of birth, ageing-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, suffering, distress, unrest appear.
So for this entire mass of suffering the rise is.</p>

<p>However, with complete fading and cessation of not knowing, cessation of inclinations. With cessation of inclinations, cessation of cognition. With cessation of cognition, cessation of name-and-form. With cessation of name-and-form, cessation of hexad-base. With cessation of hexad-base, cessation of touch. With cessation of touch, cessation of feeling. With cessation of feeling, cessation of longing. With cessation of longing, cessation of taking up. With cessation of taking up, cessation of becoming. With cessation of becoming, cessation of birth. With cessation of birth, ageing-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, suffering, distress, unrest cease.
So for this entire mass of suffering the cessation is.’</p>

<p>So said he, the clergyman, said this to the exalted one:</p>

<p>'Excellent dear Gotama, excellent dear Gotama ... I the follower, have you Gotama for endorser, from this day on while endowed with breath, as the refuge gone to.'</p>
