<p>'Meditative, almsmen, aware, an almsman should dwell.
This is our instruction to you.</p>

<p>And how, almsmen, is an almsman meditative?</p>

<p>Here, almsmen, and almsman looking into body dwells in body as the ardent aware meditator would be disciplining the avarice and distress about the world; looking into feelings dwells in feelings as the ardent aware meditator would be disciplining the avarice and distress about the world; looking into mind dwells in mind as the ardent aware meditator would be disciplining the avarice and distress about the world; looking into principles dwells in principles as the ardent aware meditator would be disciplining the avarice and distress about the world.
OK so, almsmen, is an almsmen meditative.</p>

<p>And how, almsmen, is an almsman aware?</p>

<p>Here, almsmen, feelings to an almsman he found out as they arise, he found out as they do attend, he found out as they go on as a cloud in settlement;
thoughts he found as they arise, he found as they do attend, he found as they go on as a cloud in settlement;
perceptions he found as they arise, he found as they do attend, he found out as they go on as a cloud in settlement.
OK so, almsmen, is an almsman aware.</p>

<p>Meditative, almsmen, aware, an almsman should dwell.
This is our instruction to you.'</p>
