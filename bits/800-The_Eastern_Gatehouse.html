<p>So I learned:</p>

<p>On one occasion the exalted one dwells at the eastern gatehouse, at Sāvatthi.
OK, there the exalted one addressed senior Sāriputta:  </p>

<p>'Do you believe, Sāriputta,
the strength of confidence ... the strength of vigour ... the strength of recollection ... the strength of concentration ... the strength of wisdom cultivated, made a lot of, is immersed in immortality; immortality is the relief, immortality fulfils the stopping?'</p>

<p>'OK I don't go here, venerable, by the exalted one for confidence: 
<em>the strength of ... the stopping</em>.
Of course for whom, venerable, it has not been familiarized, not viewed, not found out, not realised, not touched by wisdom, there one would go to others for this confidence: 
<em>the strength of ... the stopping</em>.
OK and for those that, venerable, have familiarized, viewed, found out, realised, touched by wisdom, there one without doubt has the reliance:
<em>the strength of ... the stopping</em>.
OK and for me this, venerable, has been familiarized, found out, realised, touched by wisdom, 
there I without doubt have the reliance: <em>the strength of ... the stopping</em>.'</p>

<p>'Good, good, Sāriputta, so for whoever, Sāriputta, it has not been familiarized, not viewed, not found out, not realised, not touched by wisdom, there those would go to others for this confidence:
<em>the strength of ... the stopping</em>.
OK and of those that, Sāriputta, have familiarized, found out, realised, touched by by wisdom, there they without doubt have the reliance:
the strength of confidence ... the strength of vigour ... the strength of recollection ... the strength of concentration ... the strength of wisdom cultivated, made a lot of, is immersed in immortality; immortality is the relief, immortality fulfils the stopping.'</p>
