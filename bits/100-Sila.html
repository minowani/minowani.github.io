<p><em>Sīla</em> is often translated as virtue.</p>

<p>A virtue is a trait, quality, that is deemed morally good. Now would you consider right concentration to be a virtue? Or right exertion? And what about right view? I do, yet those are not <em>sīla</em>.</p>

<p>And what to think of bad virtue? A bad quality which is deemed morally good? This is rather strange right? Yet <em>sīla</em> can be good or bad.</p>

<p>Good or bad speech, good or bad doing, good or bad way of life, those are <em>sīla</em>. When someone is seen with them we say they are behaving well or badly; it is seen as good or bad behaviour, so let's just call it that, behaviour.</p>

<h4>Pāḷi-English</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Sīla</strong> (nt.) behaviour.</p>
