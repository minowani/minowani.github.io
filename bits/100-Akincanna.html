<p><em>Ākiñcañña</em> is often translated as nothingness.</p>

<p>According to the dictionary <em>ākiñcaññā</em> means 'state of having nothing', absence of any possessions. But nothingness, stating that nothing really exists, is nihilism; a wrong view involving a view of self: 'nothing really exists and thus neither does a self'. Yet the texts do show that with <em>ākiñcaññāyatanaṃ</em>, this base for this supposed nothingness, there are perception and feeling, and thus cognition. Perhaps by focusing to much on the <em>state of</em> part instead of the <em>having</em> part it got shortened to nothingness, and thus lost meaning.</p>

<p>As a shorter alternative for this 'state of having nothing' <em>possessionlessness</em> would do, involving 'not self' (<em>anattā</em>) instead of 'there is no self'. Of course is a possession not you, your self; it is possessed, owned, taken up, which in turn can thus be taken down, abandoned, as well.</p>

<h4>Pāḷi-English</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Ākiñcañña</strong> (nt.) possessionlessness.</p>
